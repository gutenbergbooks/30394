<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dave Porter and His Double</span>&rdquo; is a complete
story in itself, but forms the twelfth volume
in a line issued under the general title of &ldquo;Dave
Porter Series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This series was begun some years ago by the
publication of &ldquo;Dave Porter at Oak Hall,&rdquo; in
which my young readers were introduced to a
wide-awake American lad at a typical American
boarding-school.</p>
<p>The publication of this volume was followed
by &ldquo;Dave Porter in the South Seas,&rdquo; to which
portion of our globe the lad journeyed to clear
up a question concerning his parentage. Next
came &ldquo;Dave Porter&rsquo;s Return to School,&rdquo; telling
of additional happenings at Oak Hall; &ldquo;Dave
Porter in the Far North,&rdquo; where he went on a
second journey looking for his father; &ldquo;Dave Porter
and His Classmates,&rdquo; in which our young hero
showed what he could do under most trying circumstances;
&ldquo;Dave Porter at Star Ranch,&rdquo; in
which he took part in many strenuous adventures
in the Wild West; &ldquo;Dave Porter and His
Rivals,&rdquo; in which the youth outwitted some of his
old-time enemies; &ldquo;Dave Porter on Cave Island,&rdquo;
giving the details of a remarkable sea voyage and
strange doings ashore; &ldquo;Dave Porter and the
Runaways,&rdquo; in which the boy taught some of his
school chums a much-needed lesson; &ldquo;Dave Porter
in the Gold Fields,&rdquo; whither he went in search
of a lost mine; and finally &ldquo;Dave Porter at Bear
Camp,&rdquo; which was located in the Adirondack
Mountains, and where we last left him.</p>
<p>In the present volume we find our hero in a
new field of activity. Having graduated from
school, he has taken up the study of civil engineering,
and while engaged in that calling in Texas he
becomes mixed up in most unusual happenings,
the particulars of which are given in the pages
that follow.</p>
<p>Once more I wish to thank my young readers,
and many of their parents, for all the kind things
they have said regarding my stories. I trust that
the reading of the present book will not only
please but also profit the young folks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>OFF FOR A SLEIGH-RIDE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Dave? You look
rather mystified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am mystified, Laura,&rdquo; replied Dave Porter.
&ldquo;I have a letter here that I can&rsquo;t understand at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom is it from?&rdquo; questioned Laura Porter,
as she came closer to her brother, who was ensconced
in the largest easy-chair the Wadsworth
library contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from a shopkeeper in Coburntown, Mr.
Wecks, the shoe-dealer. He wants to know which
pair of shoes I have decided to keep, and asks me
kindly to return the pair I don&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of that, Dave?&rdquo; continued his
sister, as the youth paused with a wrinkle on his
forehead. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you make up your mind which
pair of shoes you want to keep?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly can not, seeing that I haven&rsquo;t had
any shoes from Wecks&rsquo;s store,&rdquo; returned Dave,
with a faint smile. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been in his place
for nearly a year, and the last time I was there I
bought a pair of rubbers and paid for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then the letter must be meant for somebody
else, Dave. Mr. Wecks has got his customers
mixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so. But in the letter he speaks of
the two pairs of shoes I took away with me. That
looks as if somebody had gotten two pairs of shoes
in my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as we are going out sleighing this afternoon,
why don&rsquo;t you drive to Coburntown and
drop into his shop and explain matters?&rdquo; suggested
the sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that would be best, Laura.&rdquo; Dave
folded up the letter and placed it in his pocket.
&ldquo;How soon will you be ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside of quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about Jessie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was almost ready when I came downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Then we can get an early start and
have a good long ride besides stopping at
Coburntown, where I suppose you and Jessie can
do a little shopping while I am at Wecks&rsquo;s store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be fine, Dave! I would like to
match some ribbon, and the only place I can do it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
is in the French Shop in Coburntown;&rdquo; and thus
speaking Laura Porter hurried out of the room to
get ready for the sleigh-ride.</p>
<p>Dave had proposed the ride just before lunch,
and the young people living at the Wadsworth
mansion had telephoned over to the Basswood
home, asking if Ben Basswood would accompany
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I&rsquo;ll go&ndash;&ndash;be glad to!&rdquo; Dave&rsquo;s former
school chum had answered over the wire. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t a thing to do this afternoon, and a first
sleigh-ride of the season will tickle me to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want it to kill you, Ben,&rdquo; Dave
had answered gaily. &ldquo;Just the same, you be
ready for us when we come over;&rdquo; and to this
Ben had agreed.</p>
<p>Although it was still early in the winter, there
had been a heavy fall of snow two days before
and now the roads in and around Crumville were
in excellent condition for sleighing. The musical
sound of sleigh-bells could be heard in all directions,
and this had made Dave anxious to get out
on the road, even though he had to spend most of
his time indoors studying, as we shall learn later.</p>
<p>Dave had already given orders to the hostler
connected with the Wadsworth estate, and now
this man brought to the front of the mansion a
fine, big sleigh drawn by a pair of sleek-looking,
high-stepping steeds. The sleigh was well provided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
with heavy robes to protect its occupants
from the cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave, I&rsquo;m so glad to go sleighing!&rdquo;
burst out Jessie Wadsworth, as she came bounding
down the broad stairway of the mansion to
meet him. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just glorious weather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure is,&rdquo; he answered, as he gave her a
warm glance. To Dave, Jessie was the most
beautiful girl in the world, and just now, clad
as she was in her dainty sealskin coat and her
jaunty sealskin hat, she looked more bewitching
to him than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going for a ride, eh?&rdquo; came from Dave&rsquo;s
uncle, Dunston Porter, who had just finished a
belated lunch. &ldquo;Well, have a good time, and
don&rsquo;t let that pair of grays run away with you.
John was telling me they are feeling quite mettlesome
lately. I guess they don&rsquo;t get exercise
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry, Uncle Dunston. I&rsquo;m sure I
can manage them,&rdquo; answered Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you can!&rdquo; returned his uncle, heartily.
&ldquo;Too bad you couldn&rsquo;t have asked an old fellow
like me to go along,&rdquo; he continued, making a wry
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you can come along if you want to.
Can&rsquo;t he, Dave?&rdquo; burst out Jessie. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d be
very glad to have you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s only fooling, Jessie,&rdquo; answered Dave.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t hire Uncle Dunston to go sleighing
to-day. I saw him cleaning up his shotgun
right after breakfast. And I&rsquo;ll wager he has just
come in from hunting and expects to go out again
this afternoon. How about it, Uncle&ndash;&ndash;am I
right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me, Davy,&rdquo; answered the man,
with a grin. &ldquo;You see, I can&rsquo;t get over my old
habit of going hunting when I get the chance.
And now that this snow is on the ground, it&rsquo;s
just fine for tracking rabbits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get any this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few. I didn&rsquo;t go very far. This afternoon
I am going deeper into the woods, and I
guarantee to bring back enough to make the biggest
rabbit pot-pie to-morrow you ever saw;&rdquo;
and, thus speaking, the uncle hastened away.</p>
<p>He had spent many years of his life roaming
the world in quest of game both big and little,
and now, though of late years he had done his
best to settle down, it was still impossible for him
to give up his hunting habit entirely.</p>
<p>Laura soon appeared ready for the ride.
Dave had already donned his heavy overcoat, fur
cap, and his driving-gloves. He assisted the
girls into the sleigh and saw to it that they were
well tucked in with robes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a good time and don&rsquo;t stay out too
late,&rdquo; were the farewell words of Mrs. Wadsworth,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
who had come to the door to see them
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know we don&rsquo;t expect to be back to
dinner this evening,&rdquo; answered Dave. &ldquo;We can
get something to eat at Coburntown, or some
other place, and then drive back in the moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, but don&rsquo;t make it too late,&rdquo; answered
the lady of the mansion. And then Dave
took up the reins, chirped to the team, and away
the sleigh started out of the Wadsworth grounds
and down the highway leading to the Basswood
home.</p>
<p>Ben was on the lookout for them, and by the
time Dave had drawn up beside the horse-block
he was outside to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, everybody,&rdquo; he said gaily,
lifting his cap. &ldquo;This is just fine of you to take
me along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Ben come in back here with me,&rdquo; said
Laura, &ldquo;and that will give Jessie a chance to sit
in front. I know she always likes to be up
ahead,&rdquo; and Laura smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suits me,&rdquo; answered Ben, quickly; and then
assisted Jessie to make the change, which, however,
the miss did not undertake without blushing,
for it may as well be admitted here Jessie thought
as much of Dave as he did of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave, do you think the grays will behave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
themselves to-day?&rdquo; asked the girl, partly to conceal
her embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make them behave,&rdquo; he answered,
sturdily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they have been out of the
stable for several days. You know we don&rsquo;t use
the horses nearly as much as we used to, before
we got the automobile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch them.&rdquo; Dave looked behind him.
&ldquo;All right back there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered his sister. &ldquo;But please
don&rsquo;t drive too fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe sleighing will seem too fast
after the riding we have been doing in the auto,&rdquo;
answered the brother. He took up the reins
again, and once more the turnout sped along the
highway.</p>
<p>They made a turn, passed along the main street
of Crumville, and also passed the large Wadsworth
jewelry works, and then took to a road leading
to Coburntown, some miles distant. The air
was cold but clear, with the bright sunshine sparkling
on the snow, and all of the young people were
in the best of humor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Dave, how would you like to be back at
Oak Hall?&rdquo; cried Ben, while the sleigh sped
along. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t we have the dandy time snowballing
each other, and snowballing old Horsehair?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;So we would, Ben,&rdquo; answered Dave, his eyes
gleaming. &ldquo;We sure did have some good times
at that school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you and Roger getting along with
your civil engineering course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I think. Mr. Ramsdell says he is
greatly pleased with our work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine. I almost wish I had taken up
civil engineering myself. But dad wants me to
go into real estate with him. He thinks there is
a big chance in that line these days, when Crumville
is just beginning to wake up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t your dad got a big rival in Aaron
Poole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Poole isn&rsquo;t in it any more when it
comes to big deals. You see, he was so close and
miserly in all his business affairs that a great many
people became afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has become of Nat Poole?&rdquo; questioned
Laura. &ldquo;Did he go back to Oak Hall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a short while only. When his folks found
out that he had failed to graduate they were
awfully angry. Mr. Poole claimed that it was the
fault of the school and so he took Nat away and
told him he would have to go to work. I think
Nat is working in some store, although where, I
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s in Crumville or we should
have seen him,&rdquo; said Dave.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I never want to meet that boy again,&rdquo; pouted
Jessie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never get over how meanly he
acted toward us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much Nat&rsquo;s fault as it is his bringing
up,&rdquo; remarked Ben. &ldquo;His father never
treated him half decently. But I hope Nat makes
a man of himself in spite of the way he used to
treat us,&rdquo; went on the youth generously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Ben, didn&rsquo;t you say your father
had gone away?&rdquo; queried Dave, a few minutes
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has gone to Chicago on very important
business. It seems an old friend of his&ndash;&ndash;a
Mr. Enos, who was once his partner in an art
store&ndash;&ndash;died, and now the lawyers want to see my
father about settling up the Enos estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An art store?&rdquo; queried Dave. &ldquo;I never
knew that your father had been in any such business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was years ago&ndash;&ndash;before my folks came to
Crumville. You see, my father and this Mr.
Enos had been chums from early boyhood. My
father says that Mr. Enos was a very peculiar sort
of man, who was all wrapped up in pictures and
painting. He got my father to advance a thousand
dollars he had saved up, and on that money
the two opened an art store. But they couldn&rsquo;t
make a go of it, and so they gave it up, and while
Mr. Enos went West my father came here.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the dead man left your father some
money,&rdquo; suggested Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what my mother said to dad. But
he thinks not. He thinks it is more than likely
Mr. Enos died in debt and left his affairs all tangled
up, and that the lawyers want my father to
help straighten them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be able to paint,&rdquo; said Jessie, with
a sigh. &ldquo;I think some of those little water-colors
are just too lovely for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you take it up? There must be
some teacher in Crumville,&rdquo; returned Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s both do it!&rdquo; cried Laura. &ldquo;I used to
paint a little before father and I did so much
traveling. I would like to take it up again. It
would be very interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the young folks were talking, the pair
of mettlesome grays had been speeding over the
snow of the road at a good rate of speed. Dave,
however, had them well in hand, so that there was
little danger of their running away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be to Benson Crossroads soon, Dave,&rdquo;
remarked Ben a while later, after they had passed
over a long hill lined on either side with tidy farms.
&ldquo;Which road are you going to take&ndash;&ndash;through
Hacklebury or around Conover&rsquo;s Hill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made up my mind,&rdquo; answered Dave.
He looked at Jessie. &ldquo;Have you any preference?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us go up around Conover&rsquo;s Hill!&rdquo;
cried Jessie. &ldquo;That is always such a splendid
ride. There is so much of an outlook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let us go by way of the hill by all means,&rdquo;
added Laura. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t very nice through
Hacklebury, past all those woolen mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, the Conover road it is,&rdquo; answered
Dave; and forward they went once more as fast
as ever.</p>
<p>They soon passed the Crossroads, and then
took the long, winding road that led around one
side of the hill just mentioned. Here travel since
the snow had fallen had evidently been heavy, for
the roadway was packed down until it was almost
as smooth as glass. Over this surface the spirited
grays dashed at an increased rate of speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some team, believe me!&rdquo; was Ben&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;Mr. Wadsworth ought to put them on a
race-course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa does not believe in racing,&rdquo; answered
Jessie. &ldquo;But he always did like to have a horse
that had some go in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; cried Laura, a moment later.
&ldquo;What is that sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an auto coming,&rdquo; announced Ben, looking
behind them. &ldquo;A big touring-car, and whoever
is in it seems to be in a tremendous hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t cut out their muffler,&rdquo;
was Dave&rsquo;s comment, as he saw the grays pick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
up their ears. &ldquo;They have no right to run with
the muffler open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the touring-car came closer those in the
sleigh who were able to look back saw that it was
running at a great rate of speed and swaying from
side to side of the roadway. It contained four
young men, out, evidently, for a gloriously good
time. Dave did not dare look back to see what
was coming. The grays had their ears laid well
back and their whole manner showed that they
were growing more nervous every instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! Stop that noise!&rdquo; yelled Ben, jumping
up and shaking his hand at the oncoming automobile.
But those in the car paid no attention to
him. The fellow at the wheel put on a fresh
burst of speed, and with a wild rush and a roar
the touring-car shot past the sleigh and the frightened
horses, and in a few seconds more disappeared
around a turn of the road.</p>
<p>As might have been expected, the coming and
going of the big machine, with its unearthly
roar, was too much for the mettlesome grays.
Both reared up wildly on their hind legs, backing
the sleigh off to one side of the roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa there! Whoa!&rdquo; cried Dave, and did
his best to keep the team in hand. But they
proved too much for him, and in an instant more
they came down on all fours and started to run
away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING OF THE PAST</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The horses are running away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such were the cries from the two girls as the
mettlesome grays tore along the country highway
at a speed that seemed marvelous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave, can I help you?&rdquo; asked Ben, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; answered the young driver
between his set teeth. &ldquo;I guess I can bring them
down. Anyway, I can try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; wailed Jessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything&ndash;&ndash;sit still,&rdquo; ordered Dave.
He was afraid that Jessie in her excitement might
fling herself from the flying sleigh.</p>
<p>On and on bounded the frightened team. Each
of the grays now had his bit in his teeth, and it
looked as if it would be impossible for Dave to
obtain control of the pair. And, worst of all,
they were now approaching a turn, with the hill on
one side of the roadway and a gully on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better keep them as far as possible away from
the gully,&rdquo; suggested Ben.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I&rsquo;m trying to do,&rdquo; returned
Dave, setting his teeth grimly.</p>
<p>Dave Porter was a resolute youth, always doing
his best to accomplish whatever he set out to
do. Had it been otherwise, it is not likely that
he would have occupied the position in which we
found him at the opening of our story.</p>
<p>When a very small youth Dave had been found
wandering along the railroad tracks near Crumville.
He could tell little about himself or how
he had come in that position; and kind people
had taken him in and later on had placed him in
the local poorhouse. From that institution he
had been taken by an old college professor, named
Caspar Potts, who at that time had been farming
for his health.</p>
<p>In Crumville, the main industry was the Wadsworth
jewelry works, owned by Mr. Oliver Wadsworth,
who resided, with his wife and his daughter
Jessie, in the finest mansion of that district.
One day the Wadsworth automobile caught fire,
and Jessie was in danger of being burned to death,
when Dave came to her rescue. This led Mr.
Wadsworth to ask about the boy and about Mr.
Potts. And when it was learned that the latter
was one of the jewelry manufacturer&rsquo;s former
college professors, Mr. Wadsworth insisted upon
it that Caspar Potts come and live with him, and
bring Dave along.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That boy deserves a good education,&rdquo; had
been Oliver Wadsworth&rsquo;s comment, after several
interviews with Dave, and as a consequence the
youth had been sent off to a first-class boarding-school,
as related in the first volume of this series,
entitled &ldquo;Dave Porter at Oak Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the school Dave had made a host of friends,
including Roger Morr, the son of a United States
senator, and Phil Lawrence, the son of a rich
shipowner.</p>
<p>Ben Basswood, the son of a Crumville real
estate dealer and a lad who had been friendly
with Dave for several years, also went to Oak
Hall, and thus he and Dave became closer chums
than ever.</p>
<p>The great thing that troubled Dave in those
days was the question of his parentage. Some of
the mean boys in the school occasionally referred
to him as &ldquo;that poorhouse nobody,&rdquo; and this
brought on several severe quarrels and even a
fist fight or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be a nobody,&rdquo; said the youth
to himself; and when he received certain information
from an old sailor he eagerly went on a quest
after his father, as told of in &ldquo;Dave Porter in
the South Seas.&rdquo; There he managed to locate
his uncle, Dunston Porter, and learned much concerning
his father, David Breslow Porter, and
also his sister Laura.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></div>
<p>Coming back from the South Seas, Dave returned
to school, and then took a trip to the Far
North, whither his father had gone before him.
There he had many adventures, as already related
in another volume.</p>
<p>Glad to know that he had found, not only so
many kind friends, but also several rich relatives,
Dave went back again to Oak Hall. His classmates
were more than glad to see him, but others
were jealous of his success in life, and several of
his enemies, including a certain Link Merwell,
did all they could to annoy him. The annoyances
went from bad to worse, and in the end one
boy named Jasniff ran away from school, and the
other, Merwell, was expelled.</p>
<p>Dave&rsquo;s sister Laura had a friend, Belle Endicott,
who lived in the Far West, and through this
young lady Dave and his chums and also Laura
and Jessie received an invitation to spend some
time at the Endicott place, known as Star Ranch.
While in the West Dave once more fell in with
Link Merwell, and this young man, as before,
tried to make trouble, but was exposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I have seen the last of Merwell,&rdquo; said
Dave to himself, on returning once again to Oak
Hall. But this was not to be, for Merwell became
a student at a rival academy, and once more
he and some others did all they could to make
life miserable for our hero.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>When the Christmas holidays came around
Dave went back to Crumville, where he and his
folks resided with the Wadsworths, who had
taken such a liking to the youth that they did not
wish to have him live elsewhere. Directly after
Christmas came a thrilling robbery of the jewelry
works, and Dave and his chums discovered that
the crime had been committed by Merwell and his
crony, Jasniff. After a long sea voyage to Cave
Island, one of the evil-doers was captured, but
the other, Link Merwell, managed to make his
escape.</p>
<p>During Dave&rsquo;s next term at school there was
much trouble with one of the teachers, who was
harsh and unsympathetic, and as a result some of
the boys ran away. It was Dave who went after
them and who, in spite of a fearful flood, managed
to bring them back and make them face the
music. Then came the graduation exercises at
Oak Hall, Dave receiving high honors.</p>
<p>Our hero had promised Roger Morr that he
would pay the senator&rsquo;s son a visit. During this
time Dave heard of a gold mine belonging to
Mrs. Morr which had been lost because of a landslide.
All the boys went out West in an endeavor
to relocate this claim. Their adventures were
both numerous and hazardous, and once more
Dave fell in with Link Merwell. But all went
well with our young friends, and they had a glorious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
time visiting Yellowstone Park and other
points of interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you fellows have got to come on a little
trip with me,&rdquo; Phil Lawrence had said after he,
Dave and Roger, with the others, had returned
again to the East. There was a small steamer belonging
to Mr. Lawrence that was tied up at
Philadelphia getting ready for a trip to Portland,
Maine. The voyage up the Atlantic coast had
been productive of several unlooked-for results.
On the way those on the boat had discovered another
vessel in flames. This was a craft being
used by a company of moving-picture actors, and
some of the latter in their panic had leaped overboard.
Our young friends, as well as some of
the sailors on their ship, had gone to the rescue;
and among others had picked up a young man,
Ward Porton by name. Much to the surprise of
Roger Morr and Phil Lawrence, Ward Porton
had looked a good deal like Dave. Not only that,
but many of his manners, outwardly, were similar
to those of our hero.</p>
<p>Following the trip up the coast, it had been decided
by the Wadsworths and the Basswoods to
spend part of the summer in the Adirondacks, at
a spot known as Mirror Lake. Thither all of the
young people and some of the older ones went to
enjoy themselves greatly and to meet with a number
of strange happenings, all of which have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
related in detail in the volume preceding this, entitled
&ldquo;Dave Porter at Bear Camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys fell in with a wild sort of creature
whom they at first supposed to be a crazy uncle of
Nat Poole, the son of a miserly money lender of
Crumville. Later, however, the man was found
to be a missing uncle of Phil Lawrence, for whom
the Lawrence family had been seeking for a long
time.</p>
<p>Although Dave Porter did not know it at the
time, the moving-picture company to which Ward
Porton belonged had also numbered among its
members Dave&rsquo;s former school enemy, Link Merwell.
From Link, Ward Porton, who was the
good-for-nothing nephew of a Burlington lumber
dealer, had learned the particulars concerning
Dave&rsquo;s childhood and how he had been placed in
the Crumville poorhouse and listed as of unknown
parentage.</p>
<p>This had caused Porton to concoct a clever
scheme, and to Mr. Porter he announced himself
as the real Dave Porter, stating that our hero was
really and truly the nobody that years before
everybody had thought him.</p>
<p>This announcement had come like a thunderbolt
to poor Dave, and for the time being he knew
not what to do or say. The others, too, especially
his sister Laura and his dear friend, Jessie, were
almost equally affected. But they clung to him,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
refusing to believe the story that Ward Porton
was circulating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take it from me&ndash;&ndash;this is some scheme
gotten up by Link Merwell and this other fellow,&rdquo;
declared one of Dave&rsquo;s chums. And on
the strength of this declaration the youth took it
upon himself to do some clever investigating.
From one of the moving-picture actresses Dave
learned much concerning Ward Porton&rsquo;s past, and
then, in company with some of his chums, he journeyed
to Burlington, where he met Mr. Obadiah
Jones, the uncle of Porton, and asked the lumber
dealer if Ward were his real nephew or not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is my real nephew&ndash;&ndash;the son of my
youngest sister, who married a good-for-nothing
army man,&rdquo; replied Obadiah Jones; and then gave
many particulars. He stated that his sister&rsquo;s
name had been Clarice Jones Porton, and that
years before she had married a certain Lieutenant
Porton of the United States Army, an officer who
had been discharged because of irregularities in
his accounts. He further stated that the mother
of the young man was dead, and what had become
of the worthless father he did not know further
than that it had been stated he had joined some
revolutionists in Mexico.</p>
<p>Dave had gotten Mr. Jones to sign a paper
stating the exact truth concerning Ward Porton,
and with this duly witnessed had returned to Bear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
Camp. All present were glad to know that the
cloud hanging over his name had been cleared
away. His sister Laura and her friend Jessie
hugged him over and over again in their delight.</p>
<p>Then came news that Link Merwell had been
captured, and later on this misguided young man
was sent to prison for his share in the crime at
the jewelry works. A hunt was instituted for
Ward Porton, but he had taken time by the forelock
and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Ward Porton will ever bother
you again, Dave,&rdquo; said Roger one day. But the
surmise of the senator&rsquo;s son proved incorrect, as
we shall see. Ward Porton was to show himself
and make more trouble than he had ever
made before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE TEAM THAT RAN AWAY</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave, the gully!&rdquo; cried his sister Laura.
&ldquo;If we go into that we&rsquo;ll all be killed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please keep quiet, Laura,&rdquo; flung back her
brother in a low, tense voice. &ldquo;These horses are
scared enough as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave was doing his best to bring the spirited
grays out of their mad gallop. But they had not
been out of the stable for the best part of a week,
and this, combined with the scare from the roar
of the automobile, had so gotten on their nerves
that to calm them seemed next to impossible. On
and on they flew over the packed snow of the
hard road, the sleigh bouncing from side to side
as it passed over the bumps in the highway.</p>
<p>Jessie was deadly pale and had all she could do
to keep from shrieking with fright. But when
she heard Dave address his sister in the above
words, she shut her teeth hard, resolved to remain
silent, no matter what the cost. Ben was worried
as well as scared&ndash;&ndash;the more so because he
realized there was practically nothing he could do
to aid Dave in subduing the runaways. The youth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
on the front seat had braced both feet on the
dashboard of the sleigh, and was pulling back on
the reins with all the strength of his vigorous
muscles.</p>
<p>Thus fully a quarter of a mile was covered&ndash;&ndash;a
stretch of the hill road which fortunately was
comparatively straight. But then there loomed
up ahead a sharp turn, leading down to the
straight road through the valley below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave&ndash;&ndash;the turn!&rdquo; gasped Ben, unable to
keep himself from speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it. I&rsquo;ll do what I can,&rdquo; cried the young
driver; and then pulled on the reins more strongly,
if possible, than before.</p>
<p>Closer and closer to the dreaded turn in the
road the sleigh approached, and as it drew nearer
the girls huddled in their seats almost too terror-stricken
to move. Ben sprang up, totally unconscious
of doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make it, Dave, do you think?&rdquo;
gasped the real estate man&rsquo;s son, when the turn
was less than a hundred feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; was the unexpected
answer. &ldquo;Hold fast, everybody! We&rsquo;re going
through the fence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The turn in the road led to the left, and as they
approached it Dave relaxed his hold on the left
rein and pulled with might and main on the right.
This brought the team around just a trifle, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
it was enough to keep them from attempting to
follow the road&ndash;&ndash;something which would undoubtedly
have caused the slewing around of the
sleigh and probably its overturning. As it was,
the team left the roadway, and the next instant
had crashed through a frail rail-fence and was
floundering along in the deep snow of a ploughed-up
and sloping field beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa there!&rdquo; cried Dave, soothingly.
&ldquo;Whoa, Jerry! Whoa, Bill!&rdquo; And thus he
continued to talk to the team while the sleigh
bumped along through the deep snow and over
the uneven ground.</p>
<p>Running away on the smooth surface of the
highway had been one thing; keeping up such a
gait over a ploughed field and in snow almost a
foot deep was quite another. Soon the fiery grays
broke from their mad gallop into a trot, and a
minute later Dave had no trouble in bringing
them to a halt. There they stood in the snow and
the furrows of the field, snorting, and emitting
clouds of steam from their nostrils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold &rsquo;em, Dave, while I get out and go to
their heads!&rdquo; cried Ben, and an instant later was
out in the snow and had hold of the steeds. Each
of the horses was trembling a little, but the run
seemed to have done neither of them any harm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! Dave!&rdquo; gasped Jessie. She
tried to go on, but could not.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how thankful I am that you did not attempt
to go around that corner!&rdquo; came from
Laura. &ldquo;If you had tried that we would have
been upset and maybe all killed!&rdquo; and she shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just the right thing to do, Dave,&rdquo; was
Ben&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know that I
would have thought of it. You are a quick
thinker, and I guess we have you to thank for
saving our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve broken down somebody&rsquo;s fence,&rdquo;
returned Dave, not knowing what else to say.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to fix that, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! What&rsquo;s a broken fence to saving one&rsquo;s
neck!&rdquo; snorted Ben. &ldquo;Besides, we only busted
a couple of rails, and they are not worth a great
deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave, do you think it will be safe to ride behind
that team any more?&rdquo; questioned Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do it,&rdquo; he answered promptly.
&ldquo;No team of horses is going to get the better
of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, now that they have had this run,
they&rsquo;ll tame down a little,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;Besides
that, the rest of the road to Coburntown is almost
straight and flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and as soon as we get on a straight road
I&rsquo;ll give them all the running they want,&rdquo; answered
Dave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll guarantee that by the time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
we reach town they&rsquo;ll be just as meek as any one
would want them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Ben still at their heads the team was
turned around and led to the roadway once more.
There the horses were tied to a tree near by, and
then Dave and Ben spent a little time in repairing
the damage done to the fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could find out who those fellows in
the auto were,&rdquo; said Ben, when they were once
again on the way. &ldquo;They ought to be fined for
speeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if we&rsquo;ll be able to locate them,&rdquo; answered
Dave. And he was right&ndash;&ndash;they never
saw or heard of the reckless automobilists again.</p>
<p>As has been mentioned, beyond the hill the road
to Coburntown was almost straight and level.
And here for over two miles Dave allowed the
grays to go along at a good gait, although keeping
his eyes on them continually, so that they
might not get beyond control. As a consequence
of this additional burst of speed, when they came
in sight of the town for which they were bound,
the grays were quite docile and willing to behave
themselves properly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now if you say so, I&rsquo;ll take you girls around
to the French Shop,&rdquo; suggested Dave, &ldquo;and then
Ben and I can drive around to Mr. Wecks&rsquo;s shoe-store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was agreeable to Laura and Jessie, and in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
a few minutes the girls were left at the door of
the establishment where Laura had said she
wished to match some ribbon. Then the two boys
started for the shoe-dealer&rsquo;s shop. Dave had already
acquainted Ben with the particulars of his
errand to the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do if Wecks says you
really had the shoes?&rdquo; questioned the son of the
real estate dealer, when they were on the way to
the shoe store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can he say that when I haven&rsquo;t been
near the place, Ben?&rdquo; returned Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I do know that people
have sometimes had things charged to them at the
stores which other people got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Well, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t pay for any shoes
that I did not get,&rdquo; answered our hero, simply.</p>
<p>Mr. Wecks&rsquo;s establishment was at the far end of
the main street of Coburntown; so the lads had
half a dozen blocks to cover before they reached
the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, it&rsquo;s closed!&rdquo; exclaimed Ben, as they
came in sight of the store; and he nodded in the
direction of the show window, the curtain of
which was drawn down. The curtain on the door
was also down, and on the glass was pasted a sheet
of note paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some sort of notice. I&rsquo;ll see what it is,&rdquo; answered
Dave, and, throwing the reins to Ben, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
left the sleigh. Soon he was reading what was
written on the sheet of paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Closed on account of death in the family.</i></p>
<p style='text-indent: 9.0em;'><span class='smcap'>William Wecks</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody dead. That&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; mused
Dave. &ldquo;I wonder who it can be?&rdquo; and then
he passed into a barber shop next door to find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mr. Wecks&rsquo;s father&ndash;&ndash;a very old man
who lived back in the country from here,&rdquo; explained
the barber. &ldquo;Mr. Wecks went up there
last night, and he doesn&rsquo;t expect to come back until
after the funeral, which will probably be day
after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose his clerk is around?&rdquo; questioned
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The funeral gave him a holiday, and
he was glad of it. He&rsquo;s out of town, too;&rdquo; and
having thus expressed himself, the barber turned
to wait upon a customer who had just come in, and
Dave returned to the sleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the case, you&rsquo;ll have to let the matter
rest until the next time you come to Coburntown,
or else you&rsquo;ll have to write to Mr. Wecks,&rdquo;
said Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be coming over again before very long,&rdquo;
answered Dave. &ldquo;But, just the same, I&rsquo;d like to
have this matter settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Dave was speaking to his chum a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
passed him on the sidewalk, looking at him rather
fixedly. This man was Mr. Asa Dickley, the proprietor
of the largest gentlemen&rsquo;s furnishing
establishment of which Coburntown boasted.
Our hero knew the man fairly well, having purchased
a number of things at his place from time
to time, and so he nodded pleasantly. Mr. Asa
Dickley nodded in return, but with a rather sour
expression on his face. Then he glanced at Ben,
and at the handsome sleigh and still more stylish
team of horses, and passed on muttering something
to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dickley didn&rsquo;t look very happy,&rdquo; was
Dave&rsquo;s comment, as he and Ben entered the sleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he likes my father very much,&rdquo;
answered the son of the real estate dealer. &ldquo;He
wanted to get a piece of property here very cheap,
and my father found another customer for the
place at five hundred dollars more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see, Ben. Just the same, why should he
give me such a hard look? Of course, I haven&rsquo;t
been in his place of business for a good while.
But he can&rsquo;t expect me to buy all my furnishing
goods from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know how it is, Dave&ndash;&ndash;when you
buy some things from some storekeepers they
think they are entitled to your whole trade.
However, I shouldn&rsquo;t let the matter worry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much! I&rsquo;ve got other things to think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
about. Don&rsquo;t forget that I expect next month to
take that examination in civil engineering.
That&rsquo;s what is on my mind just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll pass, don&rsquo;t worry, Dave. Just
think of what a brilliant showing you made at Oak
Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. But my studies in civil engineering
have been a good deal harder than anything I
tackled at school. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Mr. Ramsdell,
the old civil engineer who is coaching Roger and
me, I don&rsquo;t know how I would possibly have
gotten along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you pass the examination, what will you do
next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger and I will go out on some constructive
work and thus get a taste of real engineering.
Mr. Ramsdell thinks he can get us positions with
the Mentor Construction Company of Philadelphia,
who are now doing a good deal of work in
Texas&ndash;&ndash;laying out railroads and building
bridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Texas? Say! that&rsquo;s quite a distance from
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, Ben. But it is not as far as I expect
to get some day. If I ever make anything of civil
engineering I hope some day to be able to do some
great work in other parts of the world&ndash;&ndash;maybe
in Mexico or South America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that will be great!&rdquo; cried Ben, enthusiastically.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a fine chance to see the
world. You must take after your uncle, Dave.
He was always a great fellow to travel. Think
of how you located him years ago away down on
that island in the South Seas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sure was a great trip! And some day I&rsquo;d
like to take it over again. But just now I&rsquo;ve got
to put in all my time on this civil engineering
proposition. I think I&rsquo;ll be lucky if I pass and
get that chance to go to Texas.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>WARD PORTON AGAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>A quarter of an hour later the girls had finished
their shopping and rejoined the boys. Then
it was decided that the party should go on to Clayton,
six miles farther. They were told that the
road was in excellent condition, and this proved
to be a fact, so that the sleighing was thoroughly
enjoyed.</p>
<p>It was growing dark when they drove down the
main street of Clayton, and, although a bit early,
all agreed to Dave&rsquo;s suggestion that they get dinner
at the leading restaurant&ndash;&ndash;a place at which
they had stopped a number of times and which
they knew to be first-class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity Roger couldn&rsquo;t come along,&rdquo;
said Jessie to Dave just before sitting down to
the sumptuous meal which the boys had ordered.
&ldquo;I know he would have enjoyed this very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, Jessie,&rdquo; answered Dave, who
well knew what a fondness for his sister the senator&rsquo;s
son possessed. &ldquo;But, as you know, Roger
had to go home on a business matter for his father.
Senator Morr is very busy in Washington these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
days, so Roger has to take care of quite a few
matters at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer that he doesn&rsquo;t want to follow
in the footsteps of his father and take up politics?&rdquo;
went on the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Senator Morr didn&rsquo;t want him to do it. And,
besides, Roger has no taste that way. He loves
civil engineering just as much as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder you and he didn&rsquo;t persuade
Phil Lawrence to take it up, too, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Phil couldn&rsquo;t do that. You know his
father&rsquo;s shipping interests are very large, and Mr.
Lawrence wants Phil to take hold with him&ndash;&ndash;and
Phil likes that sort of thing. He is planning
right now to take several trips on his father&rsquo;s
ships this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When does that examination of yours come
off, Dave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the middle of next month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you really pass, are you going to work
away down in Texas?&rdquo; continued the girl, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can get the position,&ndash;&ndash;and if Roger is
willing to go along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to have you go so far away;&rdquo;
and Jessie pouted a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped. If I want to be a
civil engineer I&rsquo;ve got to take an opening where I
can get it. Besides, Mr. Ramsdell thinks it will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
be the best kind of training for Roger and me.
He knows the men at the head of the Mentor
Company, and will get them to give us every opportunity
to advance ourselves. That, you know,
will mean a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but Texas, Dave! Why, that is thousands
of miles away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so very many thousands, Jessie,&rdquo; he answered
with a little smile. &ldquo;The mails run regularly,
and I trust you will not forget how to write
letters. Besides that, I don&rsquo;t expect to stay in
Texas forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but when you come back from Texas,
you&rsquo;ll be going off to some other far-away place&ndash;&ndash;South
America, or Africa, or the North Pole, or
somewhere,&rdquo; and Jessie pouted again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, say, let up! I&rsquo;m not going to South
Africa, or to the North Pole either. Of course,
I may go to Mexico or South America, or to the
Far West. But that won&rsquo;t be so very soon. It
will be after I have had considerable experience in
civil engineering, and when I am older than I am
now. And you know what sometimes happens to
a fellow when he gets older?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gets married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; Jessie blushed a little. &ldquo;And
then I suppose he goes off and leaves his wife behind
and forgets all about her.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Does he? Not so as you can notice it! He
takes his wife with him&ndash;&ndash;that is, provided she
will go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the idea!&rdquo; and now, as Dave looked her
steadily in the eyes, Jessie blushed more than ever.</p>
<p>Where this conversation would have ended it is
impossible to say, but at that moment Laura interrupted
the pair, followed by Ben; and then the
talk became general as the four sat down to dinner.</p>
<p>The horses had been put up in a stable connected
with the restaurant, and after the meal it
was Dave who went out to get them and bring
them around to the front of the place. He was
just driving to the street when his glance fell upon
a person standing in the glare of an electric light.
The person had his face turned full toward our
hero, so that Dave got a good look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ward Porton!&rdquo; cried the youth in astonishment.
&ldquo;How in the world did that fellow get
here, and what is he doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like a flash the memory of the past came over
Dave&ndash;&ndash;how Ward Porton had tried to pass himself
off as the real Dave Porter and thus relegate
Dave himself back to the ranks of the &ldquo;nobodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave was crossing the sidewalk at the time, but
as soon as he had the team and the sleigh in the
street he jumped out and made his way towards
the other youth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll interview him and see what he has
to say for himself,&rdquo; murmured Dave to himself.
&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll have him arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ward Porton had been staring at our hero all
the while he was turning into the street and getting
out of the sleigh. But now, as he saw Dave
approaching, he started to walk away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Porton! I want to talk to you,&rdquo; called
out our hero. &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see you,&rdquo; returned the other
youth, hastily. &ldquo;You let me alone;&rdquo; and then,
as Dave came closer, he suddenly broke into a
run down the street. Dave was taken by surprise,
but only for a moment. Then he, too, commenced
to run, doing his best to catch the fellow
ahead.</p>
<p>But Ward Porton was evidently scared. He
looked back, and, seeing Dave running, increased
his speed, and then shot around a corner
and into an alleyway. When Dave reached the
corner he was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly was scared,&rdquo; was Dave&rsquo;s mental
comment, as he looked up and down the side street
and even glanced into the alleyway. &ldquo;I wonder
where he went and if it would do any good to look
any further for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave spent fully five minutes in that vicinity,
but without being able to discover Ward Porton&rsquo;s
hiding-place. Then, knowing that the others
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
would be wondering what had become of him, and
being also afraid that the grays might run away
again, he returned to where he had left the sleigh
standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Where did you go?&rdquo; called out
Ben, who had just emerged from the restaurant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think? I just saw that rascal,
Ward Porton!&rdquo; burst out Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Porton! You don&rsquo;t mean it? Where is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was standing under that light when I
drove out from the stable. I ran to speak to
him, and then he took to his legs and scooted
around yonder corner. I went after him, but by
the time I got on the side street he was out of
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so! It&rsquo;s too bad you couldn&rsquo;t catch
him, Dave. I suppose you would have liked to
talk to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Ben. And maybe I might have
had him arrested, although now that he has been
exposed, and now that Link Merwell is in jail,
I don&rsquo;t suppose it would have done much good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer he should show himself so close to
Crumville. One would think that he would want
to put all the distance possible between himself
and your folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Ben. Maybe he is up to some
more of his tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></div>
<p>The girls were on the lookout for the boys, and
now, having bundled up well, they came from the
restaurant, and all got into the sleigh once more.
Then they turned back in the direction of Crumville,
this time, however, taking a route which did
not go near Conover&rsquo;s Hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! were you sure it was that Ward
Porton?&rdquo; questioned his sister, when he had told
her and Jessie about the appearance of the former
moving-picture actor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was positive. Besides, if it wasn&rsquo;t Porton,
why would he run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope he doesn&rsquo;t try to do you any
harm, Dave,&rdquo; said Jessie, and gave a little shiver.
&ldquo;I was hoping we had seen the last of that horrid
young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jessie! You wouldn&rsquo;t call him horrid,
would you, when he looks so very much like
Dave?&rdquo; asked Ben, mischievously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look very much like Dave,&rdquo; returned
the girl, quickly. &ldquo;And he doesn&rsquo;t act in
the least like him,&rdquo; she added loyally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty queer to have a double that way,&rdquo;
was the comment of the real estate man&rsquo;s son.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I should like to have somebody
else looking like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you couldn&rsquo;t help it, you&rsquo;d have to put up
with it,&rdquo; returned Dave, briefly. And then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
changed the subject, which, as the others could
plainly see, was distasteful to him.</p>
<p>As they left Clayton the moon came up over a
patch of woods, flooding the snowy roadway with
subdued light. In spite of what had happened,
all of the young folks were in good spirits, and
they were soon laughing and chatting gaily. Ben
started to sing one of the old Oak Hall favorites,
and Dave and the girls joined in. The grays
were now behaving themselves, and trotted along
as steadily as could be desired.</p>
<p>When the sleighing-party reached Crumville
they left Ben Basswood at his door, and then went
on to the Wadsworth mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you have a fine ride?&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
Wadsworth, when the young folks bustled into the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was splendid, Mamma!&rdquo; cried her
daughter. &ldquo;Coming back in the moonlight was
just the nicest ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did those grays behave themselves?&rdquo; questioned
Mr. Wadsworth, who was present.
&ldquo;John said they acted rather frisky when he
brought them out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they were pretty frisky at first,&rdquo; returned
Dave. &ldquo;But I finally managed to get them to
calm down,&rdquo; he added. The matter had been
discussed by the young folks, and it had been decided
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
not to say anything about the runaway unless
it was necessary.</p>
<p>On the following morning Dave had to apply
himself diligently to his studies. Since leaving
Oak Hall he had been attending a civil engineering
class in the city with Roger, and had, in addition,
been taking private tutoring from a Mr.
Ramsdell, a retired civil engineer of considerable
reputation, who, in years gone by, had been a
college friend of Dave&rsquo;s father. Dave was exceedingly
anxious to make as good a showing as
possible at the coming examinations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are several letters for you, David,&rdquo;
said old Mr. Potts to him late that afternoon, as
he entered the boy&rsquo;s study with the mail. &ldquo;You
seem to be the lucky one,&rdquo; the retired professor
continued, with a smile. &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got is a bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe there is a bill here for me, Professor,&rdquo;
returned Dave gaily, as he took the missives
handed out.</p>
<p>Dave glanced at the envelopes. By the handwritings
he knew that one letter was from Phil
Lawrence and another from Shadow Hamilton,
one of his old Oak Hall chums, and a fellow who
loved to tell stories. The third communication
was postmarked Coburntown, and in a corner of
the envelope had the imprint of Asa Dickley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! I wonder what Mr. Dickley wants
of me,&rdquo; Dave mused, as he turned the letter over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
Then he remembered how sour the store-keeper
had appeared when they had met the day before.
&ldquo;Maybe he wants to know why I haven&rsquo;t bought
anything from him lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave tore open the communication which was
written on one of Asa Dickley&rsquo;s letterheads. The
letter ran as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Mr. David Porter</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Dear Sir</span>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought when I saw you in Coburntown to-day
that you would come in and see me; but you
did not. Will you kindly let me know why you
do not settle up as promised? When I let you
have the goods, you said you would settle up by
the end of the week without fail. Unless you
come in and settle up inside of the next week I
shall have to call the attention of your father to
what you owe me.</p>
<p class='ralign' style="margin-right:10.0em">&ldquo;Yours truly,<br />
<br />
&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Asa Dickley</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>WHAT ASA DICKLEY HAD TO SAY</h3>
</div>
<p>Dave read the letter received from Mr. Asa
Dickley with much interest. He went over it
twice, and as he did so the second time his mind
reverted to the communication received the morning
before from Mr. Wecks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world does Mr. Dickley mean by
writing to me in this fashion?&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t had anything from him in a long while,
and I don&rsquo;t owe him a cent. It certainly is a
mighty strange proceeding, to say the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then like a flash another thought came into his
mind&ndash;&ndash;was Ward Porton connected in any way
with this affair?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody must have gotten some things in
my name from Mr. Dickley, and he must have
gotten those shoes from Mr. Wecks, too. If the
party went there in person and said he was Dave
Porter, I don&rsquo;t think it could have been any one
but Ward Porton, because, so far as I know, he&rsquo;s
the only fellow that resembles me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero was so much worried that he gave
scant attention to the letters received from Phil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
Lawrence and Shadow Hamilton, even though
those communications contained many matters of
interest. He was looking at the Dickley communication
for a third time when his sister entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dave, no more bad news I hope?&rdquo;
said Laura, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is bad news,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Just read
that;&rdquo; and he turned the letter over to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you owe Mr. Dickley any money you ought
to pay him,&rdquo; said the sister, after perusing the
epistle. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think father would like it if
he knew you were running into debt,&rdquo; and she
gazed anxiously at Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura! You ought to know me better than
that,&rdquo; he answered somewhat shortly. &ldquo;I never
run any bills unless I am able to pay them. But
this is something different. It is in the same line
with the one I got from Mr. Wecks. I didn&rsquo;t get
his shoes, and I haven&rsquo;t gotten anything from Mr.
Dickley for a long time, and nothing at all that
I haven&rsquo;t paid for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! do you mean it?&rdquo; and now Laura&rsquo;s
face took on a look of worry. &ldquo;Why, somebody
must be playing a trick on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is, it&rsquo;s a mighty mean trick, Laura. But
I think it is more than a trick. I think it is a
swindle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swindle?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. And what is more, do you know
who I think is guilty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, who could be guilty?&rdquo; The sister
paused for a moment to look at her brother.
&ldquo;Oh, Dave! could it be that awful Ward Porton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the fellow I fasten on. Didn&rsquo;t we meet
him in Clayton? And that&rsquo;s only six miles from
Coburntown. More than likely that rascal has
been hanging around here, and maybe getting a
whole lot of things in my name.&rdquo; Dave began to
pace the floor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame! If I could get
hold of him I think I would have him locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do about this letter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go to Coburntown the first
chance I get and tell Mr. Dickley, and also Mr.
Wecks, the truth. I want to find out whether the
party who got those things procured them in person
or on some written order. If he got them on
a written order, somebody must have forged my
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better tell father or Uncle Dunston
about this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just yet, Laura. It will be time enough
to worry them after I have seen Mr. Wecks and
Mr. Dickley. Perhaps I can settle the matter
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave was so upset that it was hard for him to
buckle down to his studies; and he was glad that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
evening when an interruption came in the shape of
the arrival of his old school chum and fellow engineering
student, Roger Morr.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back again! And right side up with care!&rdquo;
announced the senator&rsquo;s son, as he came in and
shook hands. &ldquo;My! but I&rsquo;ve had a busy time
since I&rsquo;ve been away!&rdquo; he replied in answer to a
question of Dave&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I had to settle up one or
two things for father, and then I had to go on
half a dozen different errands for mother, and
then see to it that I got those new text books that
Mr. Ramsdell spoke about. I got two copies of
each, Dave, and here are those that are coming to
you,&rdquo; and he passed over three small volumes.
&ldquo;And that isn&rsquo;t all. I just met Ben Basswood
at the depot where he was sending a telegram to
his father, who is in Chicago. Ben had some wonderful
news to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asked Laura and Jessie
simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t give me any of the particulars, but
it seems an old friend of theirs died out in Chicago
recently, and Mr. Basswood was sent for by
some lawyers to help settle the estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we know that much,&rdquo; broke in Dave.
&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s the new news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it seems this man, Enos, died quite
wealthy, and he left almost his entire estate to Mr.
Basswood.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so!&rdquo; cried Dave. &ldquo;That sure is
fine! I don&rsquo;t know of anybody who deserves
money more than do the Basswoods,&rdquo; and his face
lit up with genuine pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be nice for Ben,&rdquo; said Jessie, &ldquo;and
even nicer for Mrs. Basswood. Mamma says
there was a time when they were quite poor, and
Mrs. Basswood had to do all her own work.
Now they&rsquo;ll be able to take it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they are far from poor,&rdquo; returned Dave.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been living on &lsquo;Easy Street,&rsquo; as the saying
goes, for a number of years. Just the same,
it will be a fine thing for them to get this fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one thing about the news that Ben
didn&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; continued Roger. &ldquo;His
father telegraphed that the estate was a decidedly
curious one, and that was why the lawyers wanted
him to come to Chicago immediately. He added
that Mr. Enos had proved to be a very eccentric
individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he was as eccentric as that man in
Rhode Island I once read about,&rdquo; said Dave, with
a grin. &ldquo;When he died he left an estate consisting
of about twelve thousand ducks. This estate
went to two worthless nephews, who knew nothing
at all about their uncle&rsquo;s business. And, as
somebody said, the two nephews very soon made
&lsquo;ducks and drakes&rsquo; of the whole fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a story!&rdquo; cried Jessie, laughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
&ldquo;Twelve thousand ducks! What ever would a
person do with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, some duck farms are very profitable,&rdquo;
returned Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose this Mr. Enos left such a
fortune as that to Mr. Basswood?&rdquo; queried
Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what the fortune consists
of. And neither did Ben. He was tremendously
curious to know. And he said his mother
could hardly wait until Mr. Basswood sent additional
information,&rdquo; replied Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben told me that this Mr. Enos was once a
partner of his father in business, the two running
an art store together. Enos was very much interested
in art; so it&rsquo;s possible the fortune he left
may have something to do with that,&rdquo; added Dave.</p>
<p>As my old readers know, Roger Morr had always
thought a great deal of Laura; and of late
his liking for her had greatly increased. On her
part, Dave&rsquo;s sister had always considered the senator&rsquo;s
son a very promising young man. Consequently,
it can well be imagined that the four
young people spent a most enjoyable time that
evening in the mansion. The girls played on the
piano and all sang, and then some rugs were
pushed aside, a phonograph was brought into action,
and they danced a number of the latest steps,
with the older folks looking on.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span></div>
<p>Roger was to remain over for several days at
Crumville, and early the next morning Dave asked
his chum if he would accompany him on a hasty
trip to Coburntown. He had already acquainted
Roger with the trouble he was having with the
shoe-dealer and the man who sold men&rsquo;s furnishings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can take a horse and cutter and be back
before lunch,&rdquo; said Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to go,&rdquo; answered the senator&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a ride in a cutter this winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were soon on the way, Dave this time
driving a black horse that could not only cover the
ground well, but was thoroughly reliable. By ten
o&rsquo;clock they found themselves in Coburntown, and
made their way to the establishment run by Asa
Dickley. The proprietor of the store was busy
with a customer at the time, and a clerk came forward
to wait on the new arrivals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to speak to Mr. Dickley,&rdquo; said Dave;
and he and Roger waited until the man was at
leisure. Mr. Dickley looked anything but pleasant
as he walked up to our hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got a very strange letter from you, Mr.
Dickley. I can&rsquo;t understand it at all,&rdquo; began
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t understand why you treat me the
way you do,&rdquo; blurted out the shopkeeper. &ldquo;You
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
promised to come in here and settle up over a
week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dickley, I think there is a big mistake
somewhere,&rdquo; said Dave, as calmly as he could.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t owe you any money, and I can&rsquo;t understand
why you should write me such a letter as
this,&rdquo; and he brought forth the communication he
had received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t owe me any money!&rdquo; ejaculated
Asa Dickley. &ldquo;I just guess you do! You owe
me twenty-six dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-six dollars!&rdquo; repeated Dave.
&ldquo;What is that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For? You know as well as I do! Didn&rsquo;t
you come in here and get a fedora hat, some shirts
and collars and neckties, and a pair of fur-lined
gloves, and a lot of underwear? The whole bill
came to just twenty-six dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when was this stuff purchased?&rdquo; went
on Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was it purchased? See here, Porter,
what sort of tom-foolery is this?&rdquo; cried Asa
Dickley. &ldquo;You know as well as I do when you
got the things. I wouldn&rsquo;t be so harsh with you,
only you promised me faithfully that you would
come in and settle up long before this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dickley, I haven&rsquo;t had any goods from
you for a long, long time&ndash;&ndash;and what I have had
I have paid for,&rdquo; answered Dave, doing his best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
to keep his temper, because he knew the storekeeper
must be laboring under a mistake. &ldquo;As
a matter of fact, I haven&rsquo;t been in your store for
several months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; ejaculated the storekeeper. &ldquo;Do
you mean to deny that you bought those goods
from me, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do deny it. As I said before, I
haven&rsquo;t been in this store for several months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this plain declaration made by Dave, Mr.
Asa Dickley grew fairly purple. He leaned over
his counter and shook his clenched fist in Dave&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that is the way you are going to try to
swindle me out of my money, is it, Dave Porter?&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;Well, let me tell you, it won&rsquo;t
work. You came here and got those goods from
me, and either you&rsquo;ll pay for them or I&rsquo;ll sue
your father for the amount. Why, it&rsquo;s preposterous!&rdquo;
The storekeeper turned to his clerk,
who was gazing on the scene in open-mouthed
wonder. &ldquo;Here a customer comes in and buys a
lot of goods and I am good-hearted enough to
trust him to the amount, twenty-six dollars, and
then he comes here and declares to my face that
he never had the things and he won&rsquo;t pay for
them. Now what do you think of that, Hibbins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s pretty raw,&rdquo; responded the clerk.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you in the shop when I let Porter
have some of those goods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly was,&rdquo; answered Hibbins. &ldquo;Of
course, I was in the rear, sorting out those new
goods that had come in, so I didn&rsquo;t see just what
you let him have; but I certainly know he got
some things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dickley, now listen to me for a minute,&rdquo;
said Dave in a tone of voice that arrested the
man&rsquo;s attention in spite of his irascibility. &ldquo;Look
at me closely. Didn&rsquo;t the fellow who got those
things from you look somewhat different from
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave faced the storekeeper with unflinching
eyes, and Asa Dickley was compelled to look the
youth over carefully. As he did this the positive
expression on his face gradually changed to one
of doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;Of course, he looked like
you,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;Of course you can
change your looks a little; but that don&rsquo;t count
with me. Besides, didn&rsquo;t you give me your name
as Dave Porter, and ask me if I didn&rsquo;t remember
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow who got those goods may have
done all that, Mr. Dickley. But that fellow was
not I. I may be mistaken, but I think it was a
young man who resembles me, and who some time
ago made a great deal of trouble for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! That&rsquo;s a fishy kind of story, Porter.
If there is such a person he must look very
much like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does. In fact, some people declare they
can hardly tell us apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of that fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ward Porton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he live around here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where he is living just at present.
But I saw him day before yesterday in Clayton.
I tried to stop him, but he ran away from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The storekeeper gazed at Dave for a moment
in silence, and then pursed up his lips and shook
his head decidedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is too much of a fish story for me to
swallow,&rdquo; he said harshly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll either have
to bring that young man here and prove that he
got the goods, or else you&rsquo;ll have to pay for them
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>MORE TROUBLE</h3>
</div>
<p>Dave and Roger spent the best part of half an
hour in Asa Dickley&rsquo;s store, and during that time
our hero and his chum gave the particulars of
how they had become acquainted with Ward Porton,
and how the young moving-picture actor had
tried to pass himself off as the real Dave Porter,
and how he had been exposed and had disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if what you say is true I&rsquo;ve been
swindled,&rdquo; declared the storekeeper finally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like to get my hands on that young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like it any better than I would,&rdquo;
returned Dave, grimly. &ldquo;You see, I don&rsquo;t know
how far this thing extends. Mr. Wecks has been
after me to pay for some shoes that I never got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that moving-picture actor must be a
lulu!&rdquo; declared the storekeeper&rsquo;s clerk, slangily.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t watch out, Porter, he&rsquo;ll get you
into all kinds of hot water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the best you can do, Dave, is to notify
the storekeepers you do business with to be on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
the lookout for Porton,&rdquo; suggested Roger.
&ldquo;Then, if he shows up again, they can have him
held until you arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll certainly have to do something,&rdquo; answered
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose you don&rsquo;t want to settle that
bill?&rdquo; came from Asa Dickley, wistfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. And I don&rsquo;t think you ought to
expect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. The fellow who got
those goods said he was Dave Porter,&rdquo; vouchsafed
the storekeeper doggedly.</p>
<p>From Asa Dickley&rsquo;s establishment Dave, accompanied
by his chum, drove around to the store
kept by Mr. Wecks. He found the curtains still
down, but the shoe-dealer had just come in, and
was at his desk writing letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you mean to say you didn&rsquo;t get those
shoes?&rdquo; questioned Mr. Wecks with interest,
after Dave had explained the situation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
mighty curious. I never had a thing like that
happen before.&rdquo; He knew our hero well, and
trusted Dave implicitly. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have sent
that letter only I had a chance to sell a pair of
shoes that size, and I thought if you had made
your selection I could sell the pair you didn&rsquo;t
want to the other fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again the two boys had to tell all about
Ward Porton and what that young rascal was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
supposed to be doing. As they proceeded Mr.
Wecks&rsquo;s face took on a look of added intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly! Exactly! That fits in with what
I thought when that fellow went off with the
shoes,&rdquo; he declared finally. &ldquo;I said to myself,
&lsquo;Somehow Dave Porter looks different to-day.
He must have had a spell of sickness or something.&rsquo;
That other chap was a bit thinner and
paler than you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a regular cigarette fiend, and that is, I
think, what makes him look pale,&rdquo; put in Roger.
And then he added quickly: &ldquo;Do you remember&ndash;&ndash;was
he smoking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was. He threw a cigarette stub away
while he was trying on the shoes, and then lit another
cigarette when he was going out. I thought
at the time that he was probably smoking more
than was good for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t smoke at all, and never have done
so,&rdquo; said Dave. He turned to his chum. &ldquo;I
think the fact that the fellow who got the shoes
was smoking is additional proof that it was Porton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea that it was anybody
else,&rdquo; answered the senator&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Mr. Wecks promised to keep on the lookout
for Ward Porton, in case that individual showed
himself again, and then Dave and Roger left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going into all the stores where I do business
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
and tell the folks to be on the watch for Ward
Porton,&rdquo; said our hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good idea, Dave. But see here! How
are they going to tell him from you?&rdquo; and the
senator&rsquo;s son chuckled. &ldquo;You may come along
some day and they may hold you, thinking you are
Porton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of that, Roger, and I&rsquo;ll leave each
of them my signature on a card. I know that
Ward Porton doesn&rsquo;t write as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This idea was followed out, the boys spending
the best part of an hour in going around Coburntown.
Then they drove back to Crumville, and
there Dave visited some other establishments with
which he was in the habit of doing business.</p>
<p>All the storekeepers were much interested in
what he had to tell, and all readily agreed to have
Ward Porton detained if he should show himself.
At each place Dave left his signature, so that there
might be no further mistake regarding his identity.</p>
<p>After that several days passed quietly. Both
Dave and Roger were applying themselves to
their studies, and as a consequence saw little of
Ben except in the evenings, when all the young
folks would get together for more or less of a
good time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more news about that fortune in Chicago?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
asked Dave, one evening of the Basswood
lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; answered Ben. &ldquo;Father
telegraphed that he was hunting for some things
that belonged to Mr. Enos. He said that as soon
as he found them he would tell us all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly is a strange state of affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange? I should say it was!&rdquo; cried the
other. &ldquo;Mother and I are just dying to know
what it all means. One thing is certain&ndash;&ndash;Mr.
Enos did not leave his fortune in stocks or bonds
or real estate, or anything like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following day came additional trouble
for Dave in the shape of a communication from
a hotel-keeper in Coburntown. He stated that
he had heard through Asa Dickley that Dave was
having trouble with a party who was impersonating
him, and added that a person calling himself
Dave Porter was owing him a bill of fifteen dollars
for five days&rsquo; board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this the limit?&rdquo; cried Dave, as he
showed the letter to his father and his Uncle
Dunston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use in talking, Dave, we&rsquo;ll have to get
after that rascal,&rdquo; announced the father. &ldquo;If
we don&rsquo;t, there is no telling how far he&rsquo;ll carry this
thing. I think I&rsquo;ll put the authorities on his
track.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<p>Two days after that, and while Dave was continuing
his studies as diligently as ever, came word
over the telephone from Clayton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Dave Porter?&rdquo; came over the
wire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered our hero. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Nat Poole talking. I am up here in
Clayton&ndash;&ndash;in the First National Bank. You
know my father got me a job here last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know it, Nat. But I&rsquo;m glad to
hear you have something to do, and I hope you&rsquo;ll
make a success of it,&rdquo; returned Dave promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called you up to find out if you were in
Clayton,&rdquo; continued the son of the money lender.
&ldquo;I wanted to make sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not. I&rsquo;m right here at home,
Nat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, in that case, I want to tell you that
the fellow who looks like you is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you mean&ndash;&ndash;in the bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he came in here to get a five-dollar bill
changed. I happened to see him as he was going
out and I called to him, thinking it was you.
When I called he seemed to get scared, and he
got out in a hurry. Then I happened to think
about that fellow who looked like you, and I made
up my mind I&rsquo;d call you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long ago since he was in the bank?&rdquo;
questioned Dave, eagerly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than ten minutes ago. I tried to
get you sooner but the wire was busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t any idea where he went?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, except that he started down the side street
next to the bank, which, as maybe you know, runs
towards the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Nat. Thank you very much for
what you&rsquo;ve told me. I want to locate that fellow
if I possibly can. He is a swindler, and if you
clap eyes on him again have him arrested,&rdquo; added
Dave; and this Nat Poole promised to do.</p>
<p>The news over the wire excited Dave not a little.
Of the men of the household, only old Professor
Potts was in, and he, of course, could not
assist in the matter. Dave at once sought out
Mrs. Wadsworth and told her of what he had
heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll drive to Clayton and see if I can
locate Porton,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Roger says he will
go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you think best, Dave,&rdquo; answered the
lady of the house. &ldquo;But do keep out of trouble!
This Ward Porton may prove to be a dangerous
character if you attempt to corner him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Roger and I can manage him, if only
we can find him,&rdquo; returned the youth.</p>
<p>Once more the black horse and the cutter were
brought into service, and the two youths made the
best possible time on the snowy highway that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
led through Coburntown to Clayton. Arriving
there, they called at the bank and interviewed
Nat Poole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If what you say about Porton is true he certainly
must be a bad one&ndash;&ndash;almost as bad as Merwell
and Jasniff,&rdquo; was the comment of the money
lender&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;I certainly hope you spot him and
bring him to book. That&rsquo;s the way he went the
last I saw of him,&rdquo; he added, pointing down the
side street.</p>
<p>Dave and Roger drove down the street looking
to the right and the left for a possible sight of
Ward Porton. But their search was doomed to
disappointment for the moving-picture actor was
nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal like looking for a needle in a
haystack,&rdquo; was the comment of the senator&rsquo;s son,
after a full hour had been spent in the hunt.</p>
<p>They had left the sleigh and had walked
around a number of mills and tenement houses
which were situated in that locality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea,&rdquo; said Dave, as several children
approached them. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to ask the
youngsters if they&rsquo;ve seen a young man who looks
like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first boys and girls to whom the subject
was broached shook their heads and declared they
had seen nobody that resembled Dave. Then
our hero and his chum passed on to other children,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
and finally to some men working around a newly-constructed
tenement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why sure! I saw a young feller wot looked
like you,&rdquo; said a youth who was piling up some
lumber. &ldquo;He ast me fer a match. Say! he
looked like he could have been your twin,&rdquo; he
added in wonder; and then continued suddenly:
&ldquo;Maybe youse is playin&rsquo; a trick on me, and it was
youse got the match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never met you before,&rdquo; answered Dave,
quickly. &ldquo;When did you meet the other fellow,
and where? I am very anxious to locate him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was down on de bridge, about an hour ago.
I was comin&rsquo; dis way, and he was goin&rsquo; de udder
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he smoking a cigarette?&rdquo; asked Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had one o&rsquo; de coffin-nails in his hand and
he lit up after I given him de match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say anything?&rdquo; questioned our hero.</p>
<p>The carpenter&rsquo;s helper scratched his head for
a moment. &ldquo;Sure he did! He ast me if it was
putty good walkin&rsquo; to Bixter. I told him &lsquo;putty
fair,&rsquo; and den he went on and I came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he must have gone on to Bixter!&rdquo; cried
Roger. &ldquo;How far is that from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two miles and a half,&rdquo; answered Dave.
He turned to the carpenter&rsquo;s helper. &ldquo;Much
obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s all right. Say! but dat guy certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
looks like you,&rdquo; the carpenter&rsquo;s helper added,
with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, we&rsquo;ll follow him,&rdquo; said Dave to his
chum, and led the way on the run to where the
horse was tied.</p>
<p>Soon they were in the cutter once more. Dave
urged the black along at his best speed, and over
the bridge they flew, and then along the road leading
to the village of Bixter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>FACE TO FACE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you catch Porton, Dave, what will you do&ndash;&ndash;turn
him over to the authorities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Roger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Bixter much of a place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. There are but two stores and two
churches and not over thirty or forty houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you may have some trouble in finding
an officer. Probably the village doesn&rsquo;t boast of
anything more than a constable and a Justice of
the Peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not worrying about that yet, Roger,&rdquo; returned
our hero, grimly. &ldquo;We have got to catch
Porton first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that. But if he started for Bixter
on foot we ought to be able to locate him. A
stranger can&rsquo;t go through such a small place without
somebody&rsquo;s noticing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and on trotted the horse, past many well-kept
farms, and then through a small patch of
timber land. Beyond the woods they crossed a
frozen creek, and then made a turn to the northward.
A short distance beyond they came in sight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
of the first houses that went to make up the village
of Bixter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve not seen anything of him yet,&rdquo;
remarked the senator&rsquo;s son, as they slowed up and
looked ahead and to both sides of the village
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I don&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; returned
Dave. &ldquo;From what that carpenter&rsquo;s helper said,
I thought we should overtake him before we got
to Bixter. Either he must have left this road,
or else he must be some walker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see where he could have gone if he
left the road, Dave. All we passed were lanes
leading to the farms, and a path through that
wood. It isn&rsquo;t likely he would take to the woods
in this cold weather&ndash;&ndash;not unless he was going
hunting, and that chap back in Clayton didn&rsquo;t say
anything about his carrying a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the horse in a walk, they passed down
the village street and back again. As they did
this they kept their eyes wide open, peering into
the various yards and lanes that presented themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s no use unless he is in one of
these houses or in one of the stores,&rdquo; was Roger&rsquo;s
comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask at the stores,&rdquo; returned Dave.</p>
<p>The inquiries he and his chum made were
productive of no results so far as locating Ward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Porton was concerned. No one had seen or
heard of the former moving picture actor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the strangers we&rsquo;ve seen to-day was a
cigar drummer,&rdquo; said one of the shopkeepers.
&ldquo;And he was a fat man and about forty years
old.&rdquo; The other storekeeper had had no
strangers in his place.</p>
<p>Hardly knowing what to do next, Dave and
Roger returned to the cutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he went farther than this,&rdquo; suggested
Roger. &ldquo;We might go on a mile or two and take
a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that they had come so far, Dave thought
this a good idea, and so they passed on for a distance
of nearly two miles beyond Bixter. Here
the sleighing became poor, there being but few
farmhouses in that vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; said Dave, finally. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go
back to Bixter, take another look around, and
then return to Clayton and home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they arrived once more at the village
Dave suggested that he and his chum separate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a number of these lanes that lead
to some back roads,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;Perhaps if
we tramp around on foot and ask some of the country
folks living around here we may get on the
track of the fellow we are after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The senator&rsquo;s son was willing, and he was soon
walking down a lane leading to the right while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
Dave went off to the left. Presently Dave came
to a barn where a farmer was mending some
broken harness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Back again, are you?&rdquo; cried the
farmer, as he looked at Dave curiously. &ldquo;What
brought you? Why didn&rsquo;t you stop when I called
to you before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re just the man I want to see,&rdquo;
cried Dave, quickly. And then, as the farmer
looked at him in increasing wonder, he added:
&ldquo;Did a young man who looks very much like me
go past here to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look like you?&rdquo; queried the farmer.
&ldquo;Why, it was you, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It must have been a fellow who resembles
me very closely. I am trying to catch
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I swan!&rdquo; murmured the farmer, looking
at Dave critically. &ldquo;That other feller
looked as much like you as could be. Wot is he&ndash;&ndash;your
twin brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thankful to say he is no relative of mine.
He is a swindler, and that is why I would like to
catch him. He has been getting goods in my
name. If he went past here perhaps you can tell
me where he has gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He walked past here less than fifteen minutes
ago. He went down that lane, which is a short
cut to the road to Barnett.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Barnett!&rdquo; cried our hero. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the railroad
station up this way, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he must be heading for a railroad
train!&rdquo; exclaimed Dave, quickly. &ldquo;How far is
it from here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barnett is three miles by the road, but it&rsquo;s
less than a mile and a quarter by that short cut
through Gerry&rsquo;s Woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll go after him by that short cut,&rdquo; answered
Dave. He thought for a moment. To
hunt up Roger and get him to go along might take
too long. He looked at the farmer. &ldquo;Would
you like to go with me? I&rsquo;ll make it worth your
while,&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but I can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to meet the man who buys my milk
down town in about fifteen minutes. He&rsquo;s a very
particular customer, and if I should fail him he
might get mad. So I can&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll go after him alone,&rdquo; answered
our hero; and then continued: &ldquo;If you are going
down town, and you chance to see a friend of
mine with my black horse and cutter, will you
kindly tell him where I have gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I will;&rdquo; and with this promise from
the farmer Dave started on a swift walk along
the short cut to Barnett which the other had
pointed out.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>Fortunately for the youth, to keep his feet
warm while riding he had donned a heavy pair of
rubbers, so that walking through the rather deep
snow of the path leading through the back farms
and through Gerry&rsquo;s Woods was not as uncomfortable
as it might otherwise have been. To be
sure, he occasionally found himself floundering in
snow that was over his shoetops, but when this
happened he simply smiled grimly and made the
best of it. When at Oak Hall he had often taken
part in track athletics, cross-country running, and
occasionally in a game of hare and hounds, and
consequently his wind was good and he made
rapid progress without becoming too much exhausted.</p>
<p>He was in the depth of the woods when, at a
turn in the path, he saw a figure ahead of him.
The individual wore a heavy overcoat and had a
cap pulled well down over his ears and the back
of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be mistaken, but that looks as if it
might be Porton,&rdquo; said Dave to himself. &ldquo;However,
I&rsquo;ll soon know;&rdquo; and he increased his speed
so that he might catch up to the other walker.</p>
<p>As the ground was covered with snow our hero
made but slight noise while he advanced, and as
a consequence he drew quite close to the other individual
before the latter was aware of his presence.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hi there!&rdquo; called out Dave, when he was
but a few feet behind. The fellow had stopped
and turned around, and a single glance showed
our hero that it was the youth he was seeking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave Porter!&rdquo; muttered Ward Porton, as
he recognized our hero. His manner showed that
he was much astonished, as well as chagrined, at
this unexpected meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect to meet me out here, did
you?&rdquo; remarked Dave, sharply, as he came up
alongside the former moving-picture actor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;er&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t say that
I did,&rdquo; returned Porton, lamely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been acting in a fine way, haven&rsquo;t you,
Porton?&rdquo; went on Dave, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! What have I done?&rdquo; Porton&rsquo;s
gaze was shifty. He did not dare to look our
hero in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well enough what you&rsquo;ve done,
Porton&ndash;&ndash;buying a whole lot of goods in my
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about? I didn&rsquo;t do
any such thing!&rdquo; was the blustering reply. The
former moving-picture actor was recovering from
his surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can prove that you did; and I&rsquo;m going to
hold you responsible for it,&rdquo; answered Dave,
calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Porter, I don&rsquo;t want any such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
talk from you!&rdquo; and now Ward Porton doubled
up his fists and stuck out his chin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve stood
all I am going to stand from you. I want you to
leave me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Porton, you can bluster all you please, but
it won&rsquo;t do you any good,&rdquo; answered Dave, and
his voice had a more positive ring to it than before.
&ldquo;You thought you could play this trick
on me and get away with it, but I am going to
show you it can&rsquo;t be done. I am going to hand
you over to the authorities and see that you go
to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think you can do that, Porter, you&rsquo;ve
got another guess coming. You clear out and let
me alone or I&rsquo;ll make it hot for you;&rdquo; and Ward
Porton shook his fist in Dave&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The manner of the young man who had been
obtaining goods in Dave&rsquo;s name was so aggressive
that many a youth would have been intimidated
and inclined to withdraw. But that was not our
hero&rsquo;s way. He was righteously indignant, not
only because of what the rascal before him had
done, but also because of his present threat.
Without more ado he seized hold of Porton&rsquo;s upraised
arm and backed the fellow against a tree.</p>

<span class='smcap'>He seized Porton&rsquo;s upraised arm and backed the fellow against a tree</span>.&ndash;&ndash;<i>Page 70.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, you just listen to me,&rdquo; he said sternly.
&ldquo;Your bluff and bluster won&rsquo;t do you any good.
I am going to hand you over to the authorities,
and that is all there is to it. You&rsquo;ve got to behave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
yourself and stop threatening me, or I&rsquo;ll
give you something that you won&rsquo;t want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imp, you! Let go of me!&rdquo; roared Porton,
and, bringing around his disengaged hand,
he struck Dave a glancing blow on the chin.</p>
<p>If anything more was needed to arouse our
hero&rsquo;s just ire, this blow proved more than sufficient.
As much anger as he had ever felt in his
life surged up in Dave&rsquo;s heart. He drew back,
letting go his hold&ndash;&ndash;and the next instant his fist
shot out and landed straight on Ward Porton&rsquo;s
nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; spluttered the former moving-picture
actor, and not without reason, for the stinging
blow our hero had delivered not only hurt exceedingly,
but also caused the blood to flow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now will you behave yourself and come with
me, or do you want some more?&rdquo; demanded
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix you for that! Just wait!&rdquo; bellowed
Porton; and then he made a savage rush at our
hero.</p>
<p>The next instant they were locked in each
other&rsquo;s arms and swaying from side to side, each
doing his utmost to gain the mastery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE BASSWOOD FORTUNE</h3>
</div>
<p>Over and over in the snow of the woods rolled
Dave and Porton, first one being on top and then
the other. Each was encumbered by his heavy
overcoat and his gloves, so that to send in a decisive
blow was practically impossible.</p>
<p>The former moving-picture actor fought desperately,
for he had no desire to go to jail, and
he realized that Dave meant to send him to such
a place if he could possibly accomplish it.</p>
<p>Dave, on his part, was angered through and
through, not only because of what Porton had
done at the stores, but also because of the way
the former moving-picture actor had threatened
him.</p>
<p>The encounter had occurred at a spot where
the trees were somewhat scattered and where
rocks were numerous. As the two continued
their struggle they sent the loose snow flying in
all directions and often struck on some of the
rocks.</p>
<p>At last Dave managed to get his opponent by
the throat, and he forced Porton&rsquo;s head backward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
against a large stone. In the meantime, however,
the rascal managed to double up one of his legs,
and he gave Dave a shove in the stomach which
sent him rolling over on his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll fix you!&rdquo; panted Porton, and, releasing
his right hand, he picked up a loose stone
which their scuffle had exposed to view. The
next instant he brought the stone up, hitting our
hero on the side of the head. It was a furious
blow, and for the moment Dave was stunned.
He let go of the other&rsquo;s throat, and as he did this
Ward Porton arose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I guess you&rsquo;ll let me alone!&rdquo; he snarled;
and aimed a vicious kick at Dave&rsquo;s head. But
the youth, even though somewhat bewildered, had
sense enough left to dodge, and the blow landed
on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Then Porton turned and dashed wildly along
the woods path leading in the direction of Barnett.</p>
<p>It took our hero several seconds to collect himself
sufficiently to arise. His ear was ringing
from the contact with the stone, which fortunately
had been a smooth one, and his shoulder also
ached, even though the kick had been delivered
through the padding of his overcoat.</p>
<p>He gazed along the path, and was just in time
to see Porton disappearing around a bend.</p>
<p>If Dave had been thoroughly angry before, he
was now even more so; and, shaking his head to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
clear his brain, he started on a run after the fugitive.
He reached the turn in the path to see
Porton emerging from the woods and taking to
the highway leading to the railroad depot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be running to catch a train,&rdquo; thought
our hero. &ldquo;And if that is so I&rsquo;ll have to hustle
or he&rsquo;ll get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time Dave gained the highway leading
to Barnett, Ward Porton had reached the vicinity
of the first of the houses in the village. Here he
paused to glance back, and, seeing his pursuer,
shook his fist at Dave. Then he went on about
fifty yards farther, suddenly turning into a lane
between two of the houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid to go to the depot for fear I&rsquo;ll
get after him before a train comes in,&rdquo; thought
Dave. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll catch him anyway, unless he
takes to the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Dave had surmised was correct. Ward
Porton had thought to get on a train that would
stop at Barnett inside of the next ten minutes.
Now, however, he realized that to go to the depot
and hang around until the cars took their departure
would probably mean capture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound the luck! How did he manage to
get on my trail so quickly?&rdquo; muttered the former
moving-picture actor to himself. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ll have
to lay low and do my best to sneak off to some
other place. I wish it wasn&rsquo;t so cold. When I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
stop running I&rsquo;ll be half frozen. But, anyway,
I had the satisfaction of giving him one in the
ear with that rock and another in the shoulder
with my foot,&rdquo; and he smiled grimly, as he placed
his handkerchief to his bleeding nose.</p>
<p>By the time Dave reached the lane between the
houses, Porton was nowhere in sight. There
were a number of footprints in the snow, and following
these Dave passed a barn and some cow-sheds.
From this point a single pair of footprints
led over a short field into the very woods
where the encounter had taken place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to hide in the woods, sure
enough,&rdquo; reasoned our hero. &ldquo;Or else maybe
he&rsquo;ll try to get back to Clayton, or Bixter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi! What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; cried a voice
from the cow-shed, and a man showed himself,
followed by two well-grown boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m after a fellow who just ran across that
field into the woods,&rdquo; explained Dave, quickly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a thief. I want to catch him and have
him locked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, say! I thought I saw somebody,&rdquo; exclaimed
one of the boys. &ldquo;I thought it might
be Tom Jones goin&rsquo; huntin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In as few words as possible Dave explained the
situation to the farmer and his two sons, and
they readily agreed to accompany him into the
woods.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have a big job trying to locate that
chap in those woods,&rdquo; was the farmer&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;The growth back here is very thick, and my boys
have been lost in it more than once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh! we always found our way out again,&rdquo;
grumbled the older of the sons, who did not like
this statement on his parent&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Billy, but the woods are mighty thick,&rdquo;
returned his brother. &ldquo;If that feller don&rsquo;t look
out he may get lost and get froze to death to-night,
unless he knows enough to make a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was easy enough to follow the footprints to
the edge of the woods. But once there, the
brushwood and rocks were so thick that to follow
the marks one would have had to have the
eyes of an expert trailer. Dave and the farmer,
with the two boys, searched around for the best
part of a quarter of an hour, but without success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s slipped you, I guess,&rdquo; remarked the
farmer, shaking his head. &ldquo;I thought he
would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there any trails running through the
woods in this vicinity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only trail I know of is the one running
to Bixter. There is a woods road used by the
lumbermen, but that is on the other side of the
railroad tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The struggle with Ward Porton, followed by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
the run, had put Dave into quite a perspiration,
and in the depth of the woods he found it exceedingly
cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to keep on the move or I may get a
chill,&rdquo; he told the others, after another look
around. &ldquo;I guess we had better give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to offer any reward for capturin&rsquo; that
feller?&rdquo; questioned the older of the two boys,
when the four were on their way back to the cow-shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll give a reward,&rdquo; answered our hero,
promptly. &ldquo;If any of you can catch him and
have him held by the authorities I&rsquo;ll give you ten
dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Me for the ten dollars!&rdquo; cried the
youth. &ldquo;But say! how&rsquo;ll I know that feller if I
do find him?&rdquo; he questioned suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Billy, you won&rsquo;t want to hold
the wrong man,&rdquo; put in the father, with a grin.
&ldquo;If you did that, you might get into hot water,&rdquo;
and he chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be easy to recognize him,&rdquo; answered
Dave. &ldquo;Just take a good look at me. Well,
unfortunately, that other fellow resembles me very
closely. In fact, that&rsquo;s the reason I want to catch
him. That&rsquo;s how he got those goods I said he
had stolen. It&rsquo;s virtually stealing to get goods
in such an underhand manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll know the feller if he looks like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
you,&rdquo; said Billy. He turned to his younger
brother. &ldquo;Say, Paul, what do you say if we go
into the woods later on and lay low for that feller?
Maybe he&rsquo;ll come out this way after he
thinks the way is clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; declared Paul. &ldquo;If
we look around very carefully we may be able to
pick up his tracks somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It must be admitted that Dave felt much crestfallen
when he bade good-bye to the farmer and
his sons, after having left them his name and address.</p>
<p>The farmer had offered to drive him back to
Bixter, but our hero had stated that he would
rather walk and take the short cut through the
woods. When he arrived at the village he found
Roger wondering what had become of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did you catch Porton?&rdquo; queried the
senator&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did and I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Dave, with a
grim sort of smile. And he related the particulars
of what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great hambones, Dave! you certainly have
had an experience!&rdquo; was Roger&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;Let me look at that ear. I declare! it&rsquo;s quite
swollen. I hope it didn&rsquo;t hurt anything inside,&rdquo;
he added anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It rings and aches a little, Roger; but I don&rsquo;t
think it is seriously hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How about your shoulder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That feels a little sore, but that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;ll
soon get over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think you got so close to capturing
him and then he got away!&rdquo; was the sad comment
of the senator&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;It does beat all how slippery
some of those rascals are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m living in hope that those farmer boys
will locate Porton,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;I promised
them a reward of ten dollars if they did so.
That&rsquo;s a lot of money for lads living around
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that he had rejoined Roger, and had gotten
partly over the effects of his encounter with
Porton, Dave was rather loath to give up the
hunt. They managed to find a store where the
proprietor occasionally furnished lunches, and
there procured some sandwiches and hot chocolate.
Then they drove to Barnett by the regular
highway, and there took another look around for
the missing evil-doer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys have gone down to the woods to
look for him,&rdquo; announced the farmer when Dave
called on him once more. &ldquo;If they learn anything
I&rsquo;ll let you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That evening found Dave and Roger back in
Crumville, where, of course, they had to relate
the details of what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave, you must be more careful!&rdquo; cried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
Jessie, after he had told of the encounter in the
woods. &ldquo;That wicked fellow might kill you!&rdquo; and
she shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes indeed, you ought to be careful,&rdquo; said
Laura. &ldquo;Why, he seems to be almost as bad as
Merwell and Jasniff were!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he is, Laura. And if I ever get the chance
I&rsquo;ll put him where they are&ndash;&ndash;in prison,&rdquo; answered
the brother grimly.</p>
<p>As was to be expected, Dave was quite worked
up over what had occurred, and that night he did
not sleep very well. Both his father and his sister
insisted that he go to a physician and have his
ear examined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No damage done, so far as I can see,&rdquo; said
the doctor. &ldquo;But you had better bathe it with
witch-hazel and keep it warm for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day Dave settled down to his studies
as well as he was able. He hoped that word
might come in that Ward Porton had been captured,
but in this he was disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;ll steer clear of this neighborhood,
for a while at least,&rdquo; was Mr. Porter&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just my idea,&rdquo; added Dave&rsquo;s Uncle
Dunston. &ldquo;He must know that a great many
swindled storekeepers and other people are on the
watch for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave had not seen Ben Basswood for several
days. On the following evening the son of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
real estate dealer came hurrying over to the Wadsworth
mansion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got news about that Mr. Enos&rsquo;s
estate!&rdquo; cried Ben, as soon as he met Dave and
Roger. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the queerest thing you ever heard
of. Mother doesn&rsquo;t know what to make of it,
and I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope it&rsquo;s a valuable estate if it is
coming to your father,&rdquo; said the senator&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it is valuable or not,
and neither does father. He says in his telegram
it is certainly worth several thousand dollars, and
he doesn&rsquo;t know but that it may be worth a hundred
thousand dollars or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred thousand dollars!&rdquo; cried Laura,
who had come in to hear what Ben had to tell.
&ldquo;Oh, Ben, that certainly is a fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what does it consist of?&rdquo; queried Dave.
&ldquo;If it may be worth all the way from two or three
thousand dollars to a hundred thousand or more,
it must be mining stocks or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t in stocks or bonds or anything like
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what in the world does the estate consist
of?&rdquo; questioned our hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miniatures,&rdquo; answered Ben Basswood, simply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING ABOUT MINIATURES</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miniatures?&rdquo; came from all of Ben Basswood&rsquo;s
listeners in a chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean those little paintings that are
sometimes so valuable?&rdquo; continued Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; answered Ben. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
much about miniatures myself, but as soon as
mother and I heard about this queer fortune of
ours she asked the minister. You know he is
quite interested in art, and he told her that most
of these little miniatures, which are about the
size of a silver dollar or a small saucer, are usually
painted on ivory. Of course, some of them are
not so valuable, but others, especially those painted
by celebrated artists, are worth thousands of dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how many of these miniatures are there,
Ben?&rdquo; asked Roger, with increased curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father didn&rsquo;t know exactly, but said they
would number at least fifty, and maybe seventy-five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they are paintings of celebrated individuals&ndash;&ndash;kings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
queens, and like that?&rdquo; was
Dave&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, these miniatures, so father stated, are
made up almost entirely of the great fighters of
the world&ndash;&ndash;army and navy men, lieutenant-generals,
admirals, and officers like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, where in the world did this Mr. Enos
get money enough to buy such things?&rdquo; asked
Jessie, who had followed Laura into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the queer part of it,&rdquo; answered the
real-estate dealer&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;It seems, after Mr.
Enos and my father gave up business and separated,
Enos went South&ndash;&ndash;first to Texas and then
into Mexico. There he joined some men who
were opening up a gold mine. These men struck
it rich, and almost before he knew it Mr. Enos
was worth quite a lot of money. He had never
been very much of a business man&ndash;&ndash;being
wrapped up almost entirely in art&ndash;&ndash;and so he
did not know how to handle his money. He had
always had a liking for miniatures, so my father
stated, and he went in to gather this collection.
He didn&rsquo;t want any kings or queens or noted society
women, or anything like that, but he did want
every miniature ever painted of an army or a
navy fighter. Of course, my father doesn&rsquo;t know
all the particulars yet, but he has learned that Mr.
Enos put himself out a great deal to get hold of
certain miniatures, hunting for them all over Europe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
and also in this country. He even went
down to South America to get miniatures of some
of their heroes, and also picked up several in
Mexico, and one or two in Texas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His hobby must certainly have had a strong
hold on him,&rdquo; was Dave&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;But still,
that sort of thing isn&rsquo;t unusual. I heard once of
a postage-stamp collector who went all over the
world collecting stamps, and finally gave up his
last dollar for a rare stamp when he actually
hadn&rsquo;t enough to eat. Of course, he was a monomaniac
on the subject of stamp collecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my father has an idea that Mr. Enos
must have been a little queer over his miniature
collecting,&rdquo; returned Ben. &ldquo;But even so, the
fact remains that he left his collection of miniatures
behind him, and that they are now the property
of my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is your father going to do with
them?&rdquo; questioned Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know yet. You see, the settling
of the estate is in a very mixed-up condition. He
is going to stay in Chicago for a week or so, and
then he&rsquo;ll probably bring the miniatures East with
him and have some art expert place a valuation
on them. After that I suppose he&rsquo;ll offer the
miniatures for sale to art galleries and rich collectors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was about all Ben could tell concerning the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
fortune left to his parent. The young folks
talked the matter over for quite a while, and were
presently joined by the older people, including
Caspar Potts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miniatures, eh?&rdquo; said the genial old professor,
beaming mildly on Ben. &ldquo;Very curious!
Very curious indeed! But some of them are wonderful
works of art, and bring very good prices.
I remember, when a young man, attending a sale
of art works, and a miniature of one of the English
nobility was knocked down for a very large
sum, several thousand dollars if I remember
rightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s very fine to get hold of a fortune,
no matter in what shape it is,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Wadsworth. &ldquo;Just the same, Ben, I think your
father would prefer to have it in good stocks and
bonds,&rdquo; and he smiled faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of that, sir,&rdquo; was the prompt answer.
&ldquo;But, as you say, miniatures are much
better than nothing. In fact, I&rsquo;d rather take a
fortune in soft soap than not get it at all,&rdquo; and at
this remark there was a general laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my gracious, Ben! what would you do
with a hundred thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of soft
soap?&rdquo; queried Laura, slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d go around and smooth down all my
friends and enemies with it,&rdquo; the boy returned, and
this caused another laugh.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></div>
<p>Several more days passed, and during that time
Dave and Roger continued to devote themselves
to their studies. Mr. Ramsdell, the old civil
engineer, was on hand to tutor the two youths,
and he declared that they were making satisfactory
progress, and that he thought they would
pass the coming examinations without much trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I felt as confident about it as Mr.
Ramsdell does,&rdquo; observed our hero to his chum
one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same here, Dave,&rdquo; returned Roger.
&ldquo;Every time I think of that examination I fairly
shake in my shoes. Passing at Oak Hall wasn&rsquo;t
a patch to passing as a civil engineer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been another fall of snow, and now
sleighing was even better than before. Jessie
and Laura went out in company with their uncle,
and on their return both showed some excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave&ndash;&ndash;Roger&ndash;&ndash;what do you think!&rdquo;
cried Laura. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a letter from Belle Endicott,
and she is coming on from Star Ranch to
spend several weeks with me, and she is going to
bring along one of her old school chums, Cora
Dartmore. What do you think of that? Won&rsquo;t
it be fine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly will be, Laura,&rdquo; answered her
brother. &ldquo;When do you expect them to arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming on immediately; so I suppose
they&rsquo;ll be here in a day or two if they are
following this letter.&rdquo; Laura looked inquiringly
at Dave. &ldquo;What a pity Phil Lawrence isn&rsquo;t
here,&rdquo; she half whispered.</p>
<p>Both of them knew that during the visit of the
young folks to the Endicott ranch the shipowner&rsquo;s
son and Belle Endicott had become exceedingly
friendly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve invited Phil to come here,&rdquo; answered
Dave. &ldquo;I guess all I&rsquo;ve got to do is to
mention Belle to him and he&rsquo;ll be on the way without
delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, by all means, send him word,&rdquo; returned
the sister. &ldquo;Then we can make up a fine
little party, for we can pair Cora Dartmore off
with Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A letter from Dave to Phil Lawrence was
dispatched that evening, and the next day came a
telegram from the shipowner&rsquo;s son stating that
he would come on that night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew the mention of Belle would fetch
Phil,&rdquo; remarked Dave to Roger, when they were
alone. &ldquo;Phil certainly has got an eye on that
girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t blame him, Dave. Belle
Endicott is a splendid girl and comes from a
splendid family. I&rsquo;ll never forget how royally
they treated us when we were at Star Ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we certainly did have one grand time,
in spite of what Link Merwell did to annoy us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, drop Link Merwell!&rdquo; Roger paused
for a moment and then went on: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer,
Dave, how just as soon as you get rid of one bad
egg like Merwell another bobs up like this Ward
Porton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is queer, Roger.&rdquo; Dave heaved a deep
sigh. &ldquo;I wish I could get on the track of that
rascal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t heard a thing, have you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can be thankful that he hasn&rsquo;t been
around buying more goods in your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think I scared him pretty well when I
met him in the woods. He&rsquo;ll probably lay low
for a while&ndash;&ndash;at least until he thinks the field is
clear again. But I&rsquo;d give a good deal if I never
saw or heard of him again,&rdquo; and Dave heaved
another sigh.</p>
<p>The next day the local paper came out with a
big article on the front page speaking about the
Basswood fortune. Mr. Basswood had returned
to town, and had been interviewed by a reporter,
and the sheet gave many of the particulars regarding
the wonderful miniatures left by Mr. Enos.
According to the paper they numbered sixty-eight
all told, and were worth from a hundred dollars
to five thousand dollars apiece. It was said that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
they had been placed in a safe deposit vault, being
packed in several plush-lined cases.</p>
<p>The paper went on to state that Mr. Basswood
thought something of bringing them to Crumville,
where they might be judged by a committee
of experts in order to ascertain their real value.
The real-estate dealer was spoken of as a man
well-known in the community, and the article concluded
by stating that all the good people of
Crumville and vicinity would undoubtedly congratulate
him on his good fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly piled it on a little thick,&rdquo; was
Dave&rsquo;s comment, after he and Roger had read
the article. &ldquo;Just the same, I agree with the
paper&ndash;&ndash;the Basswoods richly deserve the fortune
that has come to them.&rdquo; Dave had not forgotten
those days, now long gone by, when he
had been a boy just out of the poorhouse living
with Caspar Potts, and how Ben Basswood had
been his one young friend during those trying
times.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, all the young visitors
bound for the Wadsworth mansion reached
Crumville on the same train. Of course, the
others went down to the depot to meet them, and
there was a grand jollification lasting several
minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, Belle, how you have grown!&rdquo; declared
Laura, after the numerous kisses and handshakes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
had come to an end. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she growing tall,
Dave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly is,&rdquo; returned the brother. And
what they said was true&ndash;&ndash;Belle Endicott was now
tall and willowy, and exceedingly pretty to look
at,&ndash;&ndash;so much so in fact, that Phil Lawrence could
hardly take his eyes from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was mighty good of your folks to invite
me down,&rdquo; said the shipowner&rsquo;s son, when the
whole crowd was making its way over to where
the Wadsworth automobile and sleigh were standing.
&ldquo;I appreciate it, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my! you don&rsquo;t suppose we could leave
you out, Phil, with Belle here,&rdquo; returned Dave,
as he gave his chum a nudge in the ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Dave!&rdquo; Phil blushed a little,
and then winked one eye. &ldquo;How are matters
going between you and Jessie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it. And I suppose Roger has
that same old eagle eye of his on your sister
Laura?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t find him talking very much
to anybody else when Laura is around,&rdquo; was
Dave&rsquo;s dry comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we had a perfectly splendid journey!&rdquo;
cried Belle Endicott. &ldquo;And wasn&rsquo;t it the strangest
thing that we should run into Phil at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
junction where we had to change cars to get
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be some sort of mutual attraction,&rdquo;
cried Laura, mischievously. And then to hide
any possible confusion she added quickly to Cora
Dartmore: &ldquo;I hope you enjoyed the trip also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I had a splendid time,&rdquo; answered the
newcomer, a girl not quite so tall as Belle but almost
equally good-looking. &ldquo;You see, this is
my first trip to the East. Oh, I know I am going
to have a perfectly lovely time!&rdquo; she added enthusiastically.</p>
<p>The young folks piled into the sleigh and automobile,
and in a very short time arrived at the
Wadsworth mansion. Here Mrs. Wadsworth
was ready to receive the visitors, and her gracious
manner made them feel at home immediately.</p>
<p>Phil, as was his custom, insisted on rooming
with Roger and Dave, while Belle Endicott and
her chum were made comfortable in a room next
to those occupied by Jessie and Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do with you
boys,&rdquo; said Mrs. Wadsworth, laughingly. &ldquo;You
always bunk in as thick as fleas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got used to that at Oak Hall,&rdquo; returned
Dave. &ldquo;Besides that, the room is a large one
with two single beds in it, and we can easily put
in a cot;&rdquo; and so it was settled.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;My, but I&rsquo;m mighty glad to be with you two
fellows again!&rdquo; declared the shipowner&rsquo;s son,
when the youths were left to themselves. &ldquo;It
seems like a touch of old times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it does,&rdquo; returned Roger, smiling broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From now on I suppose we won&rsquo;t be able to
get together as much as we used to,&rdquo; said Dave;
&ldquo;so while we are together let us make the most
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So say we all of us!&rdquo; cried Phil and Roger,
gaily.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE BIG SLEIGHING-PARTY</h3>
</div>
<p>Of course, even with so many visitors to entertain,
Dave and Roger could not neglect their
studies; so it was arranged that every day the pair
should apply themselves diligently to their books
and to what their tutor had to say from eight
o&rsquo;clock until twelve. Then lunch would be had
and the young folks could start out to enjoy themselves
in one way or another.</p>
<p>On one occasion the three boys went hunting
with Dunston Porter in the woods back of Crumville.
They had a most delightful time, and
brought back quite a bagful of rabbits, as well as
several squirrels, and also a plump partridge, the
bird being brought down by Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was a fine shot, Davy,&rdquo; remarked his
Uncle Dunston in speaking about the partridge.
&ldquo;As fine a shot on the wing as I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crumville boasted of a good-sized pond; and
from this the snow had been cleared, giving the
young folks an opportunity for skating, which
every one of them enjoyed to the utmost. They
also attended a concert given in the church one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
evening, and even went to a moving-picture show
which had recently been opened in the town.</p>
<p>The moving pictures interested the two girls
from the Far West more than anything else, for,
so far, they had had little opportunity to take in
such a form of entertainment.</p>
<p>During those days Dave was continually on the
watch for some information concerning Ward
Porton, but no word of any kind came in, and he
finally concluded that the rascal had left that vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely he thought things were growing
too hot for him,&rdquo; was Phil&rsquo;s comment, when the
boys talked the matter over. &ldquo;He probably realized
that if he continued to go to the stores and
get goods the way he did he would be caught
sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben Basswood often went out with the others,
pairing off, as had been expected by Laura, with
Cora Dartmore. This left Belle Endicott more
or less in Phil&rsquo;s care, for which the shipowner&rsquo;s
son was grateful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my father has brought the Enos miniatures
here,&rdquo; answered Ben, one day, in reply to a
question from Dave. &ldquo;He had them in a safe
deposit vault first, but he concluded that they
would probably be just as safe at our place. You
know, he has a big safe of his own in which he
keeps all his real estate documents.&rdquo; Mr. Basswood&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
office was in a wing of his house, and all
the boys had visited it and knew that it contained
a massive steel affair about five feet square and
probably four feet deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They ought to be safe there, Ben,&rdquo; returned
Dave. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what a thief could do with
miniatures, and I don&rsquo;t believe your father&rsquo;s office
is liable to catch fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that safe must be fire-proof,&rdquo; put in
Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is fire-proof,&rdquo; returned the real
estate dealer&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;And I guess you are right
about thieves&ndash;&ndash;they would rather steal money
or jewelry or silverware, or something like that,
every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Used to a life in the open air, and to riding and
driving, the sleighing in and around Crumville
proved to be a constant delight to Belle and Cora.
As a consequence, it was arranged by the boys that
the whole crowd should go out in a large sleigh,
to be procured from the local livery stable and to
be drawn by four reliable horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put a lot of straw in the bottom of the
sleigh and make it a sort of straw-ride,&rdquo; declared
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And just to think! it will be moonlight!&rdquo;
cried his sister. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t that be the finest ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly will be!&rdquo; came from Jessie, her
eyes beaming. But then she turned suddenly to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
Dave, her face clouding a little. &ldquo;Who is going
to drive&ndash;&ndash;you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re going to have a regular man from
the livery stable,&rdquo; he answered. And then as his
sister turned away, he added in a low tone: &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t want to spend my time on the horses&ndash;&ndash;I
wanted to spend it on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave!&rdquo; murmured the girl, and blushed.
Then she gave him a look that meant a great deal.</p>
<p>The sleighing-party was to start off about two
o&rsquo;clock the next afternoon, and did not expect to
return to Crumville until well towards midnight.
They were to go to the town of Lamont, about
seventeen miles away. A new restaurant had
been opened in this town, in connection with the
hotel, and Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth had stopped
there for a meal and had pronounced it excellent,
the food being of first-class quality and an orchestra
being present to liven matters up. Ben had
thought at first that he could not accompany the
others, his father having been taken sick; but as
Mr. Basswood&rsquo;s illness was not of a serious nature,
Mrs. Basswood, knowing how disappointed
the youth would be, urged that he go along anyhow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is resting quite comfortably,&rdquo; she
told Ben; &ldquo;and the doctor says he will be around
again inside of a week, so you may as well take in
this sleighride while you have the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But there are those miniatures, mother,&rdquo;
returned Ben. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t father going to let Mr.
Wadsworth see them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wadsworth is going to have several art
critics at his home in a day or two, and then your
father is to let all of them examine the miniatures
carefully to see if he can get an idea of what
they are worth. But you need not bother your
head about that. If Mr. Wadsworth sends word
that the critics have arrived at his house I&rsquo;ll take
care of the matter.&rdquo; And so this was arranged,
and Ben went off to prepare for the sleigh-ride.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour, the big sleigh came dashing
up to the door of the Wadsworth mansion.
All of the young folks, including Ben, were on
hand and ready for the trip, each bundled up well
for protection against the cold. The sun had
been shining in the morning, but towards noon it
had gone under a heavy bank of clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks a little to me like more snow,&rdquo; observed
Dunston Porter, who was present to see
them depart. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to see
you coming back in the midst of another fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Dunston, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; cried
Laura. &ldquo;We want the moon to shine this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it will shine, Laura,&rdquo; returned the
uncle, with a wink of the eye. &ldquo;It always does
shine, even when we don&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; and then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
dodged when she laughingly picked up a chunk
of snow and threw it at him.</p>
<p>Into the big sleigh piled the girls, and the boys
quickly followed. All the back seats had been
removed, and they nestled down in the thick straw
and covered themselves with numerous robes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out that you don&rsquo;t jounce off when you
go over a bump,&rdquo; cried Dunston Porter to Phil
and Belle, who sat at the back of the turnout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll hold on, don&rsquo;t worry!&rdquo; cried Phil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m used to hanging on,&rdquo; came from the western
girl, quickly. &ldquo;Riding in this sleigh won&rsquo;t be
half as bad as hanging on to the back of a half-broken
broncho.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that&rsquo;s right, too,&rdquo; answered Dave&rsquo;s
uncle. &ldquo;Just the same, you take care. I don&rsquo;t
want you young folks to have any accidents on this
trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you all have a good time,&rdquo; came
benevolently from old Caspar Potts, as he gazed
at them and rubbed his hands. &ldquo;My, my! how
I used to enjoy sleighing when I was a young man!
And how many years ago that seems!&rdquo; he added
with a little sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay any later than midnight,&rdquo; warned
Mrs. Wadsworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back by that time unless something
unusual turns up,&rdquo; returned Dave. He turned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
the others in the sleigh. &ldquo;Everybody fixed and
ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; came back the answering cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re off.&rdquo; Dave turned to the driver,
a middle-aged colored man. &ldquo;Let her go,
Wash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yassir,&rdquo; responded Washington Bones, with
a grin. &ldquo;Giddap!&rdquo; he called to his horses.
And with a crack of the whip and a grand flourish
the turnout left the front of the Wadsworth mansion
and whirled out on to the broad highway leading
to Lamont.</p>
<p>The four horses were used to working together,
and they trotted along in fine style, causing many
a passer-by to stop and gaze at the team and the
gay load of young people in admiration. The
horses were well equipped with bells, and each
of the youths had provided himself with a good-sized
horn, so that noise was not lacking as they
dashed along past the stores and houses of Crumville.
Then they came out on the Lamont road,
where the sleighing was almost perfect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t have any such adventure as
we had at Conover&rsquo;s Hill,&rdquo; remarked Jessie to
Dave while they were spinning on their way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think these livery stable horses will
run away,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;They are used every
day, and that makes them less frisky than our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
horses, which sometimes are in the stable for a
week. Besides that, Wash Bones is one of the
most careful drivers around here. If he does
anything, he&rsquo;ll let the team hold back on him
rather than urge them to do their best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On and on flew the sleigh, the young folks chatting
gaily and occasionally bursting out into a
verse of song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give &rsquo;em our old Oak Hall song!&rdquo;
cried Dave, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; came eagerly from his two chums,
and a moment later they started up the old school
song, which was sung to the tune of Auld Lang
Syne, the girls joining in:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Oak Hall we never shall forget,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>No matter where we roam;<br />
It is the very best of schools,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>To us it&rsquo;s just like home!<br />
Then give three cheers, and let them ring<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Throughout this world so wide,<br />
To let the people know that we<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Elect to here abide!&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that takes me back to the old days at
Oak Hall,&rdquo; remarked Roger, when the singing
had come to an end. &ldquo;My, but those were the
great days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ll ever see any better,
Roger,&rdquo; answered Dave.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>The sleighing party had still three miles to go
when suddenly Laura uttered a cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s snowing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is!&rdquo; burst out Belle. &ldquo;What a
shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it won&rsquo;t amount to much,&rdquo; said Ben.
&ldquo;It often snows just a little, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first flakes to fall were large, and dropped
down lazily from the sky. But soon it grew
darker, and in a short time the snow was coming
down so thickly that it almost blotted out the
landscape on all sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some fall this!&rdquo; exclaimed Phil. &ldquo;Looks
now as if it were going to be a regular storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear! and I wanted it to be moonlight to-night!&rdquo;
wailed Laura.</p>
<p>Dave was peering around and looking anxiously
at the heavy, leaden sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is going to be a heavy storm, maybe
it might be as well for us to turn back,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn back?&rdquo; came from several of the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for, Dave?&rdquo; questioned Phil. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think a little snow is going to hurt us. Maybe it
will help to keep us warm,&rdquo; he added with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get snowed in, Phil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go on!&rdquo; interposed Roger. &ldquo;Even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
if it does keep on snowing it won&rsquo;t get very heavy
in the next couple of hours. We can hurry up
with our dinner at Lamont and be home again
before it gets very deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m willing if the rest are,&rdquo; returned
Dave, who did not wish to throw &ldquo;cold
water&rdquo; on their sport. &ldquo;Lamont it is! Go
ahead, Wash, we want to get there just as soon
as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On they plunged, the snow coming down thicker
and thicker every minute. Then, just as the outskirts
of the town were gained, they heard a curious
humming sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! What is that?&rdquo; queried Jessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wind coming up,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All did so and noted that the humming sound
was increasing. Then the wind came tearing
through the woods and down the highway with
great force, sending the snow in driving sheets into
their faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious, this looks as if it were going to
be a blizzard!&rdquo; gasped Phil, who had started up
to see what the sound meant. &ldquo;We had better
get under some kind of cover just as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be up to dat hotel in anudder minute,&rdquo;
bawled Washington Bones, to make himself heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
above the sudden fury of the elements. &ldquo;Say!
dis suah is some snowsto&rsquo;m!&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Again he cracked his whip, and once more the
four horses ploughed along as well as they were
able. They had to face both the wind and the
snow, and these combined made progress slow.
By the time the party came into sight of the hotel
with the restaurant attached, the wind was blowing
almost a gale, and the snow seemed to be coming
down in driving chunks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive us around to the side porch,&rdquo; ordered
Dave. &ldquo;It will be a little more sheltered there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yassir,&rdquo; came from the colored driver; and
soon they had come to a halt at the spot mentioned.
From under the snow and robes crawled
the boys and the girls and lost no time in running
into the hotel. Then the colored man drove the
turnout down to the stables.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;My! did you ever see such a storm!&rdquo; was
Roger&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;And how quickly it came
up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t a blizzard, it is next door to it,&rdquo;
returned Dave. And then he added quickly: &ldquo;It
looks to me as if we were going to be snowbound!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>HELD BY THE BLIZZARD</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Snowbound!&rdquo; The cry came from several
of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, snowbound, if this heavy fall continues,&rdquo;
answered Dave. &ldquo;Just see how the chunks of
snow are coming down, and how the wind is driving
them along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was certainly an interesting sight, and all the
young people watched it for some time before they
took off their wraps and prepared to sit down to
the meal, which had been ordered over the telephone
before leaving Crumville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, just listen to the wind!&rdquo; was Phil&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think it was a regular nor&rsquo;-wester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it keeps on it certainly will be a blizzard,&rdquo;
put in Roger. &ldquo;In one way we can be glad we
are under shelter, even though we are a good many
miles from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And snow or no snow, I move that we
sit down to dinner,&rdquo; continued Phil. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
go back while it is snowing and blowing like this,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
so we might as well make the best of our stay
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having ordered a meal for the colored
man, which was served in another part of the
hotel, Dave joined his friends in the restaurant.
A special table had been placed in a cozy corner,
and that was decorated with a large bouquet of
hothouse flowers, with a smaller bouquet at each
plate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how lovely!&rdquo; burst out Jessie, when she
saw the flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You folks in the East certainly know how to
spread yourselves,&rdquo; was Cora Dartmore&rsquo;s comment.
&ldquo;Just look at those beautiful flowers and
then at the fierce snowstorm outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us forget the storm!&rdquo; cried Laura.
&ldquo;It will be time enough to think about that when
we have to start for home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the truth!&rdquo; answered her brother,
gaily. &ldquo;Everybody fall to and do as much damage
to the bill-of-fare as possible;&rdquo; and this remark
caused a general smile.</p>
<p>Then the first course was served and soon all of
the party were eating and chatting with the greatest
of satisfaction.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the blizzard&ndash;&ndash;for such it
really was&ndash;&ndash;continued to increase in violence.
The wind tore along through the woods and
down the streets of the town, bringing with it first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
the heavy chunks of snow and then some hard
particles not unlike salt in appearance. The fine
snow seemed to creep in everywhere, and, driven
by the wind, formed drifts which kept increasing
in size steadily.</p>
<p>After the first course of raw oysters, came some
cream of celery soup with relishes, and then some
roast turkey with cranberry sauce and vegetables.
After that the young folks had various kinds of
dessert with hot chocolate, and then nuts with
raisins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a grand dinner!&rdquo; remarked Belle, when
they were finishing. &ldquo;Dave, you certainly know
how to order the good things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I had Roger and Phil to help me on that,&rdquo;
returned our hero. &ldquo;Trust them to order up the
good things to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And trust Dave to help us get away with
them,&rdquo; sang out the senator&rsquo;s son, gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one time when those fellows
can&rsquo;t eat,&rdquo; retorted Dave. &ldquo;That is when they
are asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At a small table not far away from where the
young people were seated, sat an elderly man and
a lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Doctor Renwick and his wife,&rdquo; said
Laura, when the meal was finished. &ldquo;They must
have been sleighing, too. I am going to speak to
them.&rdquo; For Dr. Renwick came from Crumville,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
and had often attended the Porter family, as well
as the Wadsworths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are staying here for a few days,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Renwick to Dave&rsquo;s sister, after they had
shaken hands. &ldquo;You see, the proprietor of this
hotel and restaurant is my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said Laura. &ldquo;They
certainly have a very nice place here, and the dinner
we had was just too lovely for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you folks calculating to drive back to
Crumville now?&rdquo; questioned Dr. Renwick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was our expectation,&rdquo; replied Dave,
who had followed his sister; &ldquo;but it looks pretty
fierce outside, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so, Porter. Just listen to that
wind, and see how it is driving the snow! I
shouldn&rsquo;t like to face it for any great distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others came up, and all the strangers were
introduced to the doctor and his wife, and then
the entire party left the restaurant and entered
the parlor of the hotel, from the windows of
which they could watch the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is fierce!&rdquo; remarked Phil, as
they gazed at the furious onslaught of the elements.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing as hard as ever, rattling
the windows and sending the snow against the
panes as if it were so much hail. It was impossible
to see across the street, and, although Lamont
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
boasted of a limited electric light service,
all the lights upon the street corners were out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This storm is going to break down a lot of
the wires,&rdquo; announced Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about our trying to get
back to Crumville?&rdquo; questioned Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth, Dave, I don&rsquo;t see how we
are going to make it. You don&rsquo;t want to face
that wind, do you? And going back we&rsquo;d have
to head into it nearly all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go outside and have a talk with
the driver,&rdquo; answered our hero, and went out
accompanied by Roger and Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to get home on account of my father&rsquo;s
being sick,&rdquo; announced the real estate dealer&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;Otherwise I would just as lief stay here
until to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right enough for us boys,&rdquo; put in
Roger, &ldquo;but how about the girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can leave them in Mrs. Renwick&rsquo;s care
if we have to,&rdquo; announced Dave. &ldquo;Laura and
Jessie know her very well, and I am sure she&rsquo;ll
be only too glad to play the chaperon. She&rsquo;s a
very nice lady, and the doctor is a very fine man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found that Washington Bones had had
his supper and had returned to the stable to feed
his horses. When they questioned the colored
man about getting back to Crumville he shrugged
his shoulders and shook his head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Might try it if you say so,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but it
ain&rsquo;t gwine to be no easy job, boss, and we may
git stuck somewheres so as you cain&rsquo;t git to not
even a house. Then we might all be froze to
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think it is, Wash, a blizzard?&rdquo;
questioned Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s jest what dis is, boss. And my opinion
is it&rsquo;s gwine to be a heap sight wo&rsquo;se before it
gits bettah,&rdquo; added the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right there,&rdquo; answered Dave.
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s one reason I think we ought to try
to get back to Crumville. But just the same, I&rsquo;d
hate to get stuck somewhere along the road, as he
says. We boys might be able to get out of it
along with Wash, but we couldn&rsquo;t expect the girls
to do any tramping in such deep snow and in such
a wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an old-fashioned covered walk from
the hotel to the stables, so that the boys in going
from one place to the other had not had to expose
themselves to the elements. Now, to get an idea
of how bad the storm was, Dave walked out as far
as the street, followed by his chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s ghost!&rdquo; puffed the senator&rsquo;s
son, as they stood where they could get the full
benefit of the storm. &ldquo;This is frightful, Dave!
Why, it would be nothing short of suicide to try
to go anywhere!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;guess we h-had better g-go in
and telephone that we c-c-can&rsquo;t come!&rdquo; panted
Ben; and then lost no time in returning to the
stable, followed by the others.</p>
<p>They had been outside less than five minutes,
yet the fury of the blizzard had nearly taken
their breath away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t attempt it, Wash; so you can make
arrangements to stay here to-night,&rdquo; announced
Dave. He turned to his chums. &ldquo;Come on
back to the hotel, and we will do what telephoning
is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They returned to the parlor, and there the
situation was explained to the girls and to Dr.
Renwick and his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t think of trying to get back
to-night!&rdquo; cried the doctor&rsquo;s wife, quickly.
&ldquo;There are plenty of vacant rooms here, and I&rsquo;ll
see to it that my cousin gives you good accommodations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you look after the young ladies, Mrs.
Renwick?&rdquo; questioned Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will, Dave,&rdquo; she answered graciously.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that worry you in the least.
I&rsquo;ll be glad to take charge of such a nice family,&rdquo;
and she smiled sweetly at all the girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to telephone to Crumville and
let the folks know how matters stand,&rdquo; announced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
Ben; and then he and Dave hurried to where there
was a telephone booth.</p>
<p>Here, however, they met with no success so far
as getting into communication with their folks at
Crumville was concerned. It took a long time to
get Central, and then it was announced that the
storm had taken down all the wires running to
Crumville and beyond. One wire that was down
was still connected, but, try their best, neither of
the boys was able to understand anything of what
was said over it. Then this line snapped; and
that ended all efforts to send any messages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they knew we were safe,&rdquo; said Dave.
&ldquo;Now that they don&rsquo;t know it they may worry,
thinking we are snowed in somewhere along the
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got to make the best of it,&rdquo; answered
Ben. &ldquo;I did hope to speak to mother,
to ask her how father was, and to let her know
that we were all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me, Ben, as if this blizzard might
last for several days or a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it does. But sometimes these storms clear
away almost as rapidly as they come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two youths returned to the others and announced
the failure of their effort to get into communication
with Crumville. This was disheartening
to Laura and Jessie, but as it could not be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
helped the girls said they would make the best
of it. Then Laura and Dave went off with the
doctor and his wife, to obtain accommodations
for the whole party.</p>
<p>It was learned that Dr. Renwick had a fine
apartment on the second floor, and that there were
two rooms adjoining which were vacant. These
were turned over to the four girls. The boys
were accommodated with two rooms on the floor
above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite as good as they might be,&rdquo; observed
Dave, when he and his chums inspected their
rooms, which were directly under the roof of the
country hotel. &ldquo;But they are much better than
nothing, and, as the sailors say, &lsquo;any port in a
storm.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is plenty good enough,&rdquo; returned
Phil. &ldquo;But I am glad the girls are on the floor
below. Those rooms are much better than these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the boys had no baggage, there was nothing
for them to arrange in the rooms which had been
assigned to them, so after a hasty look around
they started to go downstairs again, to rejoin the
girls in the parlor. As the boys passed the room
next to the one which Dave and Ben had elected
to occupy, the door of the apartment was opened
on a crack. Then, as the youths left the corridor
to descend the stairs, the door was opened a little
wider, and a young man peered out cautiously.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you know about that!&rdquo; muttered
the young man to himself, after the four
chums had disappeared. &ldquo;Right here at this
hotel, and going to occupy the room next to the
one I&rsquo;ve got! Could you beat it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was Ward Porton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>TIM CRAPSEY&rsquo;S PLOT</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you talking to, Port?&rdquo; questioned
a man who was resting on the bed in the room
which Ward Porton occupied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you not to call me by that name,
Crapsey?&rdquo; returned the former moving-picture
actor, as he closed the door softly and locked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the difference when we&rsquo;re alone?&rdquo;
grumbled the man called Crapsey, as he shifted
himself and rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may make a whole lot of difference,&rdquo; answered
Porton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just made a big discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A discovery?&rdquo; The man sat up on the edge
of the bed. &ldquo;Discovered how to git hold of some
money, I hope. We need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember my telling you about that fellow
who looks like me&ndash;&ndash;the fellow named Dave
Porter?&rdquo; went on the former moving-picture
actor. &ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s here in this hotel. And he
and three of his chums have the rooms next to this
one.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it?&rdquo; and now Tim Crapsey
showed his interest. &ldquo;Did they see you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much! And I don&rsquo;t intend that they
shall,&rdquo; was the decided reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know the other fellows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they are the regular bunch Porter travels
with. I&rsquo;ve got to keep out of sight of all of them.
From what they said they are evidently snowbound
here on account of this blizzard, so there is no
telling how long they will stay,&rdquo; added the former
moving-picture actor in disgust. &ldquo;Confound the
luck! I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to stay in this room a
prisoner and let you get my meals for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fellow&rsquo;s being here may not be such a
bad thing for you,&rdquo; remarked Tim Crapsey.
&ldquo;Maybe you can impersonate him and touch the
hotel clerk for a loan of ten or twenty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to run too many risks&ndash;&ndash;not
with so many of those fellows on hand. If I had
only Porter to deal with it might be different,&rdquo; returned
Ward Porton. &ldquo;Just the same, I&rsquo;m going
to keep my eyes open, and if I can get the best
of him in any way you can bet your boots I&rsquo;ll
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Dave and his chums had rejoined
the girls and Dr. Renwick and his wife in
the parlor of the hotel, and there all made themselves
as much at home as possible. There was
quite a gathering of snowbound people, and a good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
deal of the talk was on the question of how long
the blizzard might last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the people here are going to try to
get over to Pepsico,&rdquo; said one man. &ldquo;That is
only a mile and a quarter from here, and they are
hoping to get the train that goes through that
place about one o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The train may be snowbound, too,&rdquo; returned
another; &ldquo;and if it is those folks will have their
hard tramp to Pepsico for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside it was still snowing and blowing as
furiously as ever. All the street lights were out,
and so were the electric lights in the hotel, so that
the hostelry had to depend on its old-time lamps
for its illumination. But the lamps had been discarded
only the year before so it was an easy matter
to bring them into use again.</p>
<p>Not to keep the good doctor and his wife up
too long, Laura told Mrs. Renwick that they
would retire whenever she felt like it. About
half past ten good-nights were said and the girls
went upstairs with the lady, followed presently by
the doctor. The boys remained below to take another
peep out at the storm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular old-fashioned blizzard,&rdquo; announced
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no telling how long we&rsquo;ll be stalled here,&rdquo;
added Roger. &ldquo;Quite an adventure, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
and he smiled faintly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can be thankful that we weren&rsquo;t
caught somewhere along the road,&rdquo; broke in Phil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; came from Ben. &ldquo;Why, if we
had been caught in some out-of-the-way place, we
might be frozen to death trying to find some
shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two rooms which the chums occupied on
the third floor of the hotel were connected, and
before they went to bed the youths all drifted
into the one which was to be occupied by Dave and
Ben, for here it was slightly warmer than in the
other room, and the lamp gave a better light. It
seemed good to be together like this, especially on
a night when the elements were raging so furiously
outside. The former school chums talked of
many things&ndash;&ndash;of days at Oak Hall, of bitter
rivalries on the diamond, the gridiron, and on the
boating course, and of the various friends and enemies
they had made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only one of our enemies who seems to
have made a man of himself is Gus Plum,&rdquo; remarked
Dave. &ldquo;He has settled down to business
and I understand he is doing very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Nat Poole is doing fairly well,&rdquo; returned
Ben. &ldquo;I understand his father owns stock
in that bank, so they&rsquo;ll probably boost Nat along
as rapidly as his capabilities will permit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nat was never the enemy that Plum and Jasniff
and Merwell were!&rdquo; cried Phil. &ldquo;He was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
one of the weak-minded kind who thought it was
smart to follow the others in their doings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This storm is going to interfere with our
studies, Dave,&rdquo; announced Roger. &ldquo;Not but
what I&rsquo;m willing enough to take a few days&rsquo; rest,&rdquo;
he added with a grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to make up for it somehow,
Roger,&rdquo; returned our hero. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to
pass that examination with flying colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid this storm will interfere with the
art critics who were to look at those miniatures,&rdquo;
put in Ben. &ldquo;Oh, dear! I wish we knew just
what those little paintings were worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they prove to be worth at least a hundred
thousand dollars,&rdquo; said Phil. &ldquo;That will
be a nice sum of money for you folks, Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; answered the son of the real
estate dealer.</p>
<p>The youths were tremendously interested in
the miniatures, and a discussion of them ensued
which lasted the best part of half an hour. Ben
described some of the pictures as well as he was
able, and told of how they were packed, and of
how they had been placed in the Basswood safe,
waiting for the critics that Mr. Wadsworth had
promised to bring from the city to his home to inspect
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose we might as well turn in,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
said Roger, presently, as he gave a yawn. &ldquo;I
must confess I&rsquo;m tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come ahead, I&rsquo;m willing,&rdquo; announced Phil;
and then he and the senator&rsquo;s son retired to the
next room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O pshaw! what do you suppose I did?&rdquo; exclaimed
Dave to Ben, while the pair were undressing.
&ldquo;I left my overcoat and my cap on the rack
in the lower hallway. I should have brought them
up here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did the same thing,&rdquo; answered his chum.
&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ll be safe enough. All the folks
in this hotel seem to be pretty nice people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose there are any blizzard pictures
among those miniatures, Ben?&rdquo; observed Dave,
with a laugh just before turning in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a picture of one army officer in a big,
shaggy uniform which looks as if it might be worn
because of cold weather,&rdquo; answered Ben; and then,
as the miniatures were very close to his heart, the
youth began to talk about them again.</p>
<p>This discussion lasted for another quarter of
an hour, after which the chums retired and were
soon deep in the land of slumber.</p>
<p>Although none of our friends knew it, every
word of their conversation had been listened to
eagerly by Ward Porton and the man with him.
They had noted carefully all that had been said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
about the Basswood fortune, and about the miniatures
having been placed in the real estate dealer&rsquo;s
safe awaiting inspection by the critics who were
to visit Mr. Wadsworth at his mansion. Both
had noted also what Dave had said about leaving
his overcoat and his cap on the rack on the lower
floor of the hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred thousand dollars&rsquo; worth of miniatures!&rdquo;
murmured Tim Crapsey, after the sounds
in the adjoining room had ceased. &ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s
some fortune, sure enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But pictures! Humph, what good are
they?&rdquo; returned Ward Porton, in disgust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
rather have my fortune in something a little more
usable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pictures are not so bad, and miniatures
can be handled very easily,&rdquo; answered Tim Crapsey.
His small eyes began to twinkle. &ldquo;Jest
you let me git my hands on &rsquo;em, and I&rsquo;ll show you
wot I kin do. I know a fence in New York who&rsquo;ll
take pictures jest as quick as anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what would he do with them after he
got them?&rdquo; questioned Ward Porton curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;d ship &rsquo;em &rsquo;round to different places
after he got &rsquo;em doctored up, and git rid of &rsquo;em
somehow to art dealers and collectors. Of course,
he might not be able to git full value for &rsquo;em; but
if they&rsquo;re worth a hundred thousand dollars he
might git ten or twenty thousand, and that ain&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
bad, is it?&rdquo; and Tim Crapsey looked at Ward
Porton suggestively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy enough to talk, but how are you going to
get your hands on those miniatures?&rdquo; demanded
the former moving-picture actor, speaking, however,
in a low tone, so that none of those in the
next room might hear him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I jest got an idee,&rdquo; croaked Tim Crapsey.
He was a man who consumed a large amount of
liquor, and his voice showed it. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear
wot that chap said about leaving his coat and hat
downstairs? If you could fool them shopkeepers
the way you did, then, if you had that feller&rsquo;s hat
and coat, and maybe fixed up a bit to look like that
photograph you had of him, you might be able to
go to the Basswood house and fool the folks
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean this way: We could go to Crumville
and you could watch your chance, and when the
coast was clear you could git a rig and drive over
to the Basswood house and go in quite excited like
and tell &rsquo;em that this Mr. Wadsworth was a-want-in&rsquo;
to see them miniatures right away,&ndash;&ndash;that a
very celebrated art critic had called on him, but
couldn&rsquo;t stay long. Wanted to ketch a train and
all that. You could tell &rsquo;em that Mr. Wadsworth
had sent you to git the miniatures, and that he had
said that he would return &rsquo;em jest as soon as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
critic had looked &rsquo;em over. Do you ketch the
idee?&rdquo; and Tim Crapsey looked narrowly at his
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might work, although I&rsquo;d be running a big
risk,&rdquo; said Ward Porton, slowly. Yet his eyes
gleamed in satisfaction over the thought. &ldquo;But
you forgot one thing, Tim: We are snowbound
here, and we can&rsquo;t get away any quicker than they
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re mistaken, Port&ndash;&ndash;I mean
Mr. Jones,&rdquo; Crapsey checked himself hastily. &ldquo;I
heard some folks downstairs talkin&rsquo; about going
over to Pepsico to ketch the one o&rsquo;clock train.
That goes through Crumville, and if we could
ketch it we&rsquo;d be in that town long before mornin&rsquo;.
We could fix up some story about the others bein&rsquo;
left behind here, and Dave Porter comin&rsquo; home
alone. They can&rsquo;t send any telephone message,
for the wires are down, and I don&rsquo;t know of any
telegraph office here where they could send a message
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we were going to try it we&rsquo;d have to hustle,&rdquo;
announced Ward Porton. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a fierce risk,
let me tell you that,&ndash;&ndash;first, trying to get to the
railroad station, and then trying to bluff Mr. and
Mrs. Basswood into thinking I am Dave Porter.
You must remember that since I got those things
in Porter&rsquo;s name at those stores, the whole crowd
are on their guard.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t gain anything in this world
without takin&rsquo; chances,&rdquo; retorted Tim Crapsey.
&ldquo;If I looked like that feller I&rsquo;d take the chance
in a minute. Why, jest see what we could make
out of it! If you can git your hands on those
miniatures, I&rsquo;ll take care of the rest of it and we
can split fifty-fifty on what we git out of the deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ward Porton mused for a moment while Tim
Crapsey eyed him closely. Then the former moving-picture
actor leaped softly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, Tim!&rdquo; he cried in a low voice.
&ldquo;Come ahead&ndash;&ndash;let us get out of this hotel just
as soon as possible. And on the way downstairs
I&rsquo;ll see if I can&rsquo;t lift that cap and overcoat.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>WHAT WASHINGTON BONES HAD TO TELL</h3>
</div>
<p>Dave was the first of the four chums to awaken
in the morning. He glanced toward the window,
to find it covered with frost and snow, thus leaving
the room almost dark. The wind was still blowing
furiously, and the room was quite cold. Without
disturbing Ben our hero looked at his watch
and found that it was almost eight o&rsquo;clock. He
leaped up and commenced to dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! getting up already?&rdquo; came sleepily
from his roommate, as Ben stretched himself and
rubbed his eyes. &ldquo;It must be pretty early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re mistaken, Ben,&rdquo; was
Dave&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;In a few minutes more it will
be eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! How dark it is! But I
suppose it&rsquo;s the frost on the window makes that,&rdquo;
went on the real estate dealer&rsquo;s son, as he, too,
got up. &ldquo;Phew! but it&rsquo;s some cold, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
and he started to dress without delay.</p>
<p>The noise the two boys made in moving around
the room aroused the others, and soon they too
were getting up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Talk about Greenland&rsquo;s Icy Mountains!&rdquo;
commented Phil, with a shiver. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d
you like to go outside, Roger, just as you are, and
have a snowball fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing!&rdquo; retorted the senator&rsquo;s son,
who was getting into his clothing just as rapidly as
possible. &ldquo;Say, fellows, but this surely is some
snowstorm!&rdquo; he continued, as he walked to the
window and scraped some frost from a pane of
glass so that he could catch a glimpse of what was
outside. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still snowing to beat the band!&rdquo;
he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And listen to the wind!&rdquo; broke in Ben.
&ldquo;Why, sometimes it fairly rocks the building!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look much as if we were going to get
back to-day,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;I suppose the roads
are practically impassable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be if it snowed all night,&rdquo; answered
Ben. &ldquo;Let us go down and take a look
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the girls are up yet?&rdquo; questioned
Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t make much difference whether they
are or not,&rdquo; returned Dave. &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t get
away from here they may as well sleep as long as
they please. There certainly isn&rsquo;t much to do in
this small hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youths were soon washed and dressed, and
then all trooped below. They passed the rooms
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
occupied by the girls and by Dr. Renwick and his
wife, but heard no sounds coming from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are taking advantage of the storm to
have a good rest,&rdquo; commented Phil. He gave a
yawn. &ldquo;I almost wish I had remained in bed
myself. We won&rsquo;t have a thing to do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed a bowling alley next door, Phil,&rdquo; announced
Roger. &ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t do anything else
to-day we can bowl a few games. That will be
fine exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the girls know about bowling?&rdquo; questioned
Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; answered Dave. &ldquo;Laura
has bowled a few games, I believe. But it will be
fun to teach them, if we don&rsquo;t find anything better
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys walked through the small lobby of
the hotel and into the smoking room. Here several
men were congregated, all talking about the
storm and the prospects of getting away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The snow is nearly two feet deep on the
level,&rdquo; said one man; &ldquo;but the wind has carried
it in all directions so that while the road is almost
bare in some spots there are drifts six and eight
feet high in others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if we were snowed in good and
proper,&rdquo; returned another man. &ldquo;I wanted to
get to one of those stores across the way, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
had about all I could do to make it. In one place
I got into snow up to my waist, and it was all I
could do to get out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like much of a chance to get
away from here,&rdquo; observed Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are booked to stay right where we are,&rdquo;
declared Phil; &ldquo;so we might as well make the best
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go out to the barn and see what Wash
Bones has to say,&rdquo; suggested Dave. &ldquo;He has
probably been watching the storm and knows just
how things are on the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; returned Ben. &ldquo;But I am going
to put on my cap and overcoat before I go. It
must be pretty cold out there even though they
do keep the doors shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll get my cap and overcoat, too,&rdquo; said
Dave. Phil and Roger had taken their things up
to the third floor the night before, and now had
their overcoats over their arms.</p>
<p>The large rack in the hallway of the hotel was
well filled with garments of various kinds, so that
Ben had to make quite a search before he found
his own things. In the meantime, Dave was also
hunting, but without success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mighty queer,&rdquo; remarked the latter.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t seem to see my cap or my overcoat anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it must be there, Dave,&rdquo; cried his chum.
&ldquo;Just take another look. Maybe the overcoat
has gotten folded under another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both youths made a thorough search, which
lasted so long that Phil and Roger came into the
hallway to ascertain what was keeping them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave can&rsquo;t find his overcoat or his cap,&rdquo; explained
Ben. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve hunted everywhere for
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you take them up-stairs last night?&rdquo;
questioned Phil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I left them on this rack. And Ben left
his things here, too,&rdquo; replied Dave. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
understand it at all;&rdquo; and he looked worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Laura saw them and took them upstairs,
thinking they wouldn&rsquo;t be safe here,&rdquo; suggested
Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think that, Roger. However, as the
coat and cap are not here, maybe I&rsquo;d better ask
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another search for the missing things followed,
Dave looking through the parlor and the other
rooms on the ground floor of the hotel, and even
peeping into the restaurant, where a number of
folks were at breakfast. Then he went upstairs
and knocked softly on the door of the room which
Laura and Jessie were occupying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked his sister, in a somewhat
sleepy tone of voice.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s I, Laura,&rdquo; answered her brother. &ldquo;I
want to know if you brought my cap and overcoat
upstairs last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Dave, I didn&rsquo;t touch them. What
is the matter&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t you find them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, and I&rsquo;ve hunted high and low,&rdquo; he returned.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose any of the other girls
or the doctor touched them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure they did not.&rdquo; Laura came
to the door and peeped out at him. &ldquo;Are you
boys all up already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we went down-stairs a little while ago.
We were going out to the barn, and that&rsquo;s why I
wanted my overcoat and cap. They seem to be
gone, and I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it;&rdquo; and
now Dave&rsquo;s face showed increased anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; came from Jessie, and
then Laura closed the door again. Dave heard
some conversation between all of the girls, and
then between Laura and Mrs. Renwick. Then
his sister came to the door once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of us touched your cap or overcoat,
Dave,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer? Do you suppose
they have been stolen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, Laura. I&rsquo;m going down and see
the hotel proprietor about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proprietor of the hostelry was not on hand,
but his son, a young fellow of about Dave&rsquo;s age,
was behind the desk, and he listened with interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
to what our hero had to say. Then he, too, instituted
a search for the missing things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand this any more than you
can,&rdquo; he announced, after this additional search
had proved a failure. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know we had
any thieves around here. Are you sure you left
the coat and cap on this rack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am positive,&rdquo; announced Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him do it, when I placed my own things
on the same rack,&rdquo; declared Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you found your coat and cap all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty queer,&rdquo; declared the young clerk,
shaking his head. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better tell my
father about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hotel proprietor was called, and he at once
instituted a number of inquiries concerning the
missing things. But all these proved of no avail.
No one had taken Dave&rsquo;s wearing apparel, and
none of the hired help had seen any one else take
the things or wear them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have taken your things up to your
room last night,&rdquo; declared the hotel proprietor,
during the course of the search. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bad idea
to leave things on a rack like this, with so many
strangers coming and going all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He agreed to lend Dave a coat and a hat, and,
donning these, the youth walked through the little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
shelter leading to the stables, accompanied by his
chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If those things are not recovered I think you
can hold the hotel man responsible,&rdquo; remarked
Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I think,&rdquo; put in Ben. &ldquo;That overcoat
was a pretty nice one, Dave; and the cap was
a peach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see what can be done, in case the things
don&rsquo;t turn up,&rdquo; returned our hero.</p>
<p>They found Washington Bones down among
the stablemen, taking care of his horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Wash, what are the prospects for getting
away this morning?&rdquo; questioned Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t no prospects, so far as I kin see,&rdquo; declared
the colored driver. &ldquo;This suah am one
terrible sto&rsquo;m. I neber seen the like befo&rsquo; aroun&rsquo;
heah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to get back
to Crumville to-day?&rdquo; questioned Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-sir. Why, if we was to try it we&rsquo;d suah
git stuck befo&rsquo; we got out ob dis town. Some ob
de drifts is right to de top of de fust story ob de
houses.&rdquo; Washington Bones looked questioningly
at Dave. &ldquo;How did you like your trip outside
las&rsquo; night?&rdquo; he queried. &ldquo;Must ha&rsquo; been
some walkin&rsquo;, t&rsquo;rough sech deep snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My trip outside?&rdquo; questioned Dave, with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
puzzled look. &ldquo;What do you mean, Wash? I
didn&rsquo;t go out last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed the colored driver in
wonder. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I see you leavin&rsquo; de hotel las&rsquo;
night &rsquo;bout half pas&rsquo; &rsquo;levin or a little later?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly did not. I was in bed and
sound asleep by half past eleven,&rdquo; answered Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well now, don&rsquo;t dat beat all!&rdquo; cried the
colored man, his eyes rolling in wonder. &ldquo;I went
outside jest to take a las&rsquo; look aroun&rsquo; befo&rsquo; turning
in, and I seen a young fellow and a man leavin&rsquo;
de hotel. Dey come right pas&rsquo; where a lantern
was hung up on the porch, and when dat light
struck on de young fellow&rsquo;s face I thought suah
as you&rsquo;re bo&rsquo;n it was you. Why, he looked like
you, and he had on de same kind of cap and overcoat
dat you was a-wearin&rsquo; yeste&rsquo;day. I see
you&rsquo;ve got on something different to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fellow who looked like me and who had on
my cap and my overcoat!&rdquo; ejaculated Dave. He
turned to his chums. &ldquo;What do you make of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was Ward Porton!&rdquo; cried Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it was, he must have run away and taken
Dave&rsquo;s cap and overcoat with him,&rdquo; added Ben.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>MOVEMENTS OF THE ENEMY</h3>
</div>
<p>As my readers doubtless surmise, it was Ward
Porton who had made off with Dave&rsquo;s overcoat
and cap.</p>
<p>Leaving the room which they occupied on the
third floor locked, the young moving-picture actor
and his disreputable companion had stolen down
the two flights of stairs leading to the lower hallway.
Fortunately for them, no one had been
present, and it had been comparatively easy for
Porton to find Dave&rsquo;s things and put them on.
Tim Crapsey already wore his own overcoat and
hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might as well provide ourselves with rubbers
while we are at it,&rdquo; remarked Crapsey, as
his gaze fell upon a number of such footwear resting
near the rack, and thereupon each donned
a pair of rubbers that fitted him.</p>
<p>Thus equipped they had stolen out of the hotel
through a side hallway without any one in the
building being aware of their departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have a fight of it to get to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
the railroad station,&rdquo; muttered Ward Porton, as
the fury of the storm struck both of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky I know the way,&rdquo; croaked Tim
Crapsey. And then, as they passed over the
porch in the light of the lantern by which Washington
Bones had seen Porton, the man went on:
&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the matter with us stoppin&rsquo; at some
drinkin&rsquo; place and gittin&rsquo; a little liquor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; interposed his companion, hastily.
&ldquo;We want to make our get-away without being
seen if we possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nobody will know us,&rdquo; grumbled Crapsey,
who had a great fondness for liquor, &ldquo;and the
stuff may prove a life-saver if we git stuck some
place in the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The realization that they might become snowbound
on the way to Pepsico made Porton pause,
and in the end he agreed to visit a drinking place
several blocks away, which, by the light shining
dimly through the window, they could see was still
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now look here, Tim, you&rsquo;re not going to
overdo it,&rdquo; said the former moving-picture actor,
warningly. &ldquo;If we are going to pull this stunt
off you are going to keep perfectly sober. It&rsquo;s
one drink and no more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to git a flask to take along,&rdquo;
pleaded the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do that. But I give you fair warning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
that you&rsquo;ve got to go slow in using the stuff.
Otherwise we are going to part company. In
such a game as we are trying to put over, a man
has got to have his wits about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having procured a drink, and also a package
of cigarettes and a flask of liquor, the two set
off through the storm for the railroad station, a
mile and a quarter away. It was a hard and tiresome
journey, and more than once they had to
stop to rest and figure out where they were.
Twice Tim Crapsey insisted upon it that he must
have a &ldquo;bracer&rdquo; from the flask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m froze through and through,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m half frozen myself,&rdquo; retorted
Ward Porton, and when he saw the man drinking
he could not resist the temptation to take some of
the liquor himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be in a fine pickle if we get to Pepsico
and then find that the train isn&rsquo;t coming through,&rdquo;
remarked the former moving-picture actor, when
about three-quarters of the journey had been covered
and they were resting in the shelter of a
roadside barn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a chance we&rsquo;ve got to take,&rdquo; returned
his companion. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think the train will
be stormbound. Most of the tracks through here
are on an embankment, and the wind would keep
them pretty clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was after one o&rsquo;clock when the pair finally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
gained the little railroad station at Pepsico. They
found over a dozen men and several women present,
all resting in the tiny waiting-room, trusting
that the train would soon put in an appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wires are down so they can&rsquo;t tell exactly
where the train is,&rdquo; said one of the men, in reply to
a question from Porton. &ldquo;They are hoping,
though, that it isn&rsquo;t many miles away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From time to time one of the would-be passengers
would go out on the tracks to look and
listen, and at last one of these announced that a
train was on the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t tell whether it&rsquo;s a passenger train
or a freight,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s git on it even if it&rsquo;s a freight,&rdquo; said Tim
Crapsey to Ward Porton. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll take us to
Crumville jest as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, provided we can get aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the train puffed in and proved to be a
freight. On the rear, however, was a passenger
car, hooked on at the last station.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_5' id='linki_5'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i005.jpg' alt='' title='' width='324' height='500' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
<span class='smcap'>Slowly the train puffed in, and proved to be a freight</span>. <i>Page 136.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The regular passenger train is stalled in the
cut beyond Breckford,&rdquo; announced the conductor
of the freight, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s no telling when she&rsquo;ll
get out. If you folks want to risk getting
through, get aboard;&rdquo; and at this invitation all
those waiting at the station lost no time in boarding
the mixed train. Then, with a great deal of
puffing and blowing, the locomotive moved slowly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
away from Pepsico, dragging the long line of cars,
some full and some empty, behind it.</p>
<p>Long before Crumville was reached it became
a question as to whether the train would get
through or not. The snow was coming down as
thickly as ever, and the wind whistled with increased
violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ll get much farther than
Crumville,&rdquo; announced the conductor, when he
came through to collect tickets. &ldquo;We should
have passed at least two trains coming the other
way. But nothing has come along, and that
would seem to show that the line is blocked ahead
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the mixed train did not
get even as far as Dave&rsquo;s home town. Running
was all right so long as the tracks were up on the
embankment, but as soon as they reached the level
of the surrounding country the snow became so
deep that several times the train had to be backed
up so that a fresh start might be made. Then,
when they came to a cut not over three feet deep,
just on the outskirts of the town, the engineer
found it utterly impossible to get any farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to have a snow-plough to get us
out,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;or otherwise we&rsquo;ll have to
remain here until the storm clears away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By listening to the conversation of some of the
people in the car, Porton and Crapsey learned that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
it was only a short distance to the town, and they
followed several men and a woman when they left
the train to finish the journey on foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know where we are now,&rdquo; said Porton, presently,
as he and his companion struck a well-defined
road leading past the Wadsworth jewelry
works. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be right in Crumville in a little
while more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ward Porton knew very well that he must not
show himself in Crumville any more than was
necessary. Consequently, as soon as they came
within sight of the town proper, he suggested that
they look around for some place where they might
remain until daybreak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered Tim Crapsey.
And a little later, coming to a large barn, they
tried the door, and, finding it unlocked, entered
and proceeded to make themselves comfortable in
some hay, using several horse blankets for coverings.</p>
<p>Here both of them, being thoroughly exhausted,
fell sound asleep and did not awaken until
it was daylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got to lay our plans with great
care,&rdquo; announced Ward Porton. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
go at this in any haphazard way. Even though
it may prove comparatively easy to get our hands
on those miniatures, it will be another story to get
away with them in such a storm as this, with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
railroad and every other means of communication
tied up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This storm is jest the thing that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
help us,&rdquo; answered Crapsey. &ldquo;With all the telegraph
and telephone wires down the authorities
won&rsquo;t be able to send out any alarm. And with
the snow so deep, if we git any kind of a start at
all it will be next to impossible for &rsquo;em to follow
us up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A discussion of ways and means followed that
lasted the best part of an hour. Then, with
money provided by Porton, and with many an
admonition that he must not for the present drink
another drop, Tim Crapsey was allowed to depart
for Crumville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you be very careful of how you go at
things,&rdquo; warned Porton.</p>
<p>Tim Crapsey had a delicate mission to perform.
First of all he was to size up matters around the
homes of the Wadsworths and the Basswoods,
and then he was to do what he could to hire a
cutter and a fast horse at the local livery stable.
This done, he was to procure something to eat
both for himself and for his companion.</p>
<p>As time went by Ward Porton, on the alert for
the possible appearance of the owner of the barn,
became more and more anxious, and twice he went
out in the roadway to see if his companion was
anywhere in sight.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;It would be just like him to go off and get full
of liquor,&rdquo; muttered the young man, with a scowl.
&ldquo;I really ought to part company with him. But
when he is perfectly sober he certainly is a slick
one,&rdquo; he continued meditatively.</p>
<p>To pass the time the young man made a
thorough search of the overcoat which he had
stolen from Dave. He had already discovered a
fine pair of gloves and had worn them. Now,
in an inner pocket, he located a card-case containing
half a dozen addresses, some postage stamps,
and some of Dave&rsquo;s visiting cards. There were
also two cards which had been blank, and on each
of these, written in Dave&rsquo;s bold hand, was the
following:</p>
<p class='center'><i>Signature of<br />
David Porter,<br />
Crumville.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; mused the former moving-picture
actor, as he gazed at the written cards.
Then suddenly his face brightened. &ldquo;Oh, I see!
It&rsquo;s one of those cards that I heard about&ndash;&ndash;the
kind he has been distributing among the storekeepers
in an effort to catch me. Say, one of
these may come in handy when I go for those
miniatures!&rdquo; he continued.</p>
<p>At last he heard a noise outside, and looking in
that direction saw Tim Crapsey approaching in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
somewhat dilapidated cutter, drawn, however, by
a powerful-looking bay horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had a fierce time gittin&rsquo; this horse,&rdquo; announced
the man, as he came to a halt beside the
barn. &ldquo;The livery stable man didn&rsquo;t want to let
him go out, and I had to tell him a long yarn about
somebody bein&rsquo; sick and my havin&rsquo; to git a doctor.
And I had to offer him double price, too!&rdquo;
and at his own ruse the man chuckled hoarsely.</p>
<p>He had brought with him some sandwiches and
doughnuts, and also a bottle of hot coffee, and on
these both made a somewhat limited breakfast,
the man washing the meal down with another
drink from his flask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I kept my word&ndash;&ndash;I didn&rsquo;t drink a drop when
I was in town,&rdquo; he croaked. &ldquo;But say, this is
mighty dry work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep a clear head on your shoulders,
Tim,&rdquo; warned Porton. &ldquo;Some day, drink is going
to land you in jail or in the grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; snorted the man. &ldquo;I know
when to stop.&rdquo; But Porton knew that this was
not true.</p>
<p>Another conference was held, and Crapsey told
of having taken a look around, both at the Wadsworth
place and the Basswood home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one at the Basswood place but
Mr. and Mrs. Basswood; and I understand the
man is sick in bed,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All the telephone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
wires are out of commission, but to make sure
that the Basswoods couldn&rsquo;t telephone I cut the
wire that runs into his real estate office&ndash;&ndash;and I
also cut the wire up at the Wadsworth house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Tim!&rdquo; returned Ward Porton,
and then he told of having found the two
cards, each containing Dave&rsquo;s signature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; cried the man. &ldquo;That ought
to help you a great deal when you ask for the
miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it does,&rdquo; answered Ward Porton,
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Now let us go; the sooner we
get at this affair the better.&rdquo; And then both left
the barn, entered the cutter, and drove rather
slowly in the direction of the Basswood home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE RETURN TO CRUMVILLE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;If Ward Porton got my cap and overcoat he
must have been staying at this hotel,&rdquo; said Dave,
after the announcement made by Ben. &ldquo;Let us
interview the proprietor without delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and his chums hurried back into the hotel
and there met not only the proprietor but also his
son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, have you anybody staying here who
looks like me?&rdquo; demanded our hero of both of
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we&rsquo;ve got a fellow who looks like you,&rdquo;
declared the hotel-keeper&rsquo;s son before his father
could speak. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a Mr. Jones. He has a
room up on the third floor. He&rsquo;s here with an
older man named Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would take me up to their room!&rdquo;
cried Dave, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! what&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to find out whether that fellow is still
here. If he is I want him placed under arrest.&rdquo;
And then Dave related a few of the particulars
concerning Ward Porton and his doings.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly is a queer story,&rdquo; remarked
the hotel proprietor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go upstairs with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way, followed by Dave and his
chums. The youths were much astonished to see
him halt at the door next to their own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to be there, or otherwise they
are sleeping pretty soundly,&rdquo; remarked the hotel
proprietor, after he had knocked on the door
several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you had better unlock the door,&rdquo; suggested
Dave. &ldquo;I rather think you will find the
room empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A key was secured from one of the maids and
the door was opened. The proprietor gave one
look into the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Say! do you think
they have run away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just exactly what I do think,&rdquo; answered
Dave. &ldquo;And that fellow who looks like
me most likely took my cap and overcoat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say his name is Porton? He signed
our register as William Jones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s his hat and coat,&rdquo; announced Phil,
opening the door to a closet. &ldquo;Pretty poor
clothing he left you in return for yours, Dave,&rdquo;
continued the shipowner&rsquo;s son, after an inspection.</p>
<p>The hotel proprietor was very wrathy, declaring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
that Porton and his companion owed him for
three days&rsquo; board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re swindlers, that&rsquo;s what they are!&rdquo; he
cried. &ldquo;Just wait till I land on them! I&rsquo;ll put
them in jail sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d willingly give you that board money just
to get my hands on Ward Porton,&rdquo; announced
Dave. He turned to his chums. &ldquo;This sure is
the limit! First he goes to the stores and gets a
lot of things in my name and then he steals my
hat and overcoat right from under my nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that isn&rsquo;t the worst of it,&rdquo; declared
Roger. &ldquo;There is no telling where he has gone;
and even if you knew, in this awful storm it would
be next to impossible to follow him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All went below, and there they continued to discuss
the situation. In the midst of the talk the
girls came down, accompanied by Dr. Renwick
and his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! you don&rsquo;t mean to tell me that
that horrid Ward Porton has been at more of his
tricks!&rdquo; cried Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it perfectly dreadful!&rdquo; put in Jessie.
&ldquo;And to think he was right in this hotel with us
and we never knew it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what makes me so angry,&rdquo; announced
Dave. &ldquo;If only I had clapped my eyes on him!&rdquo;
he added regretfully.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no use of crying over spilt
milk,&rdquo; declared Roger. &ldquo;He is gone, and so
are Dave&rsquo;s overcoat and his cap, and that is all
there is to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of milk puts me in mind of breakfast,&rdquo;
put in Phil. &ldquo;Now that the others are
downstairs don&rsquo;t you think we had better have
something to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All were agreeable, and soon they were seated
at a large table in the dining room, in company
with the doctor and Mrs. Renwick. Here, while
eating their breakfast, they discussed the situation
from every possible standpoint, but without arriving
at any satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Porton must have seen us when we came up
to the rooms,&rdquo; said Dave to his chums. &ldquo;He
probably heard me speak about leaving my cap
and overcoat downstairs, and he just took a fiendish
delight in walking off with them and leaving
his old duds behind. Oh, he certainly is a
peach!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had there been the slightest let-up in the blizzard,
Dave and his chums would have gone out on
a hunt around the town for Porton and his unknown
companion. But with the wind blowing
almost a hurricane, and the snow coming down as
thickly as ever, Dr. Renwick told them that they
had better remain indoors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t likely that they stayed anywhere
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
around here, fearing detection,&rdquo; said the physician.
&ldquo;They probably put a good distance between
themselves and this hotel. And to go out
in such a storm as this might make some of you
sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, what of that? We have a doctor
handy,&rdquo; answered Dave, whimsically. &ldquo;Just the
same, I guess we had better remain where we
are,&rdquo; he added, with a deep sigh.</p>
<p>It was not until the following morning that the
wind died down and the snow ceased to fall. In
the meantime, the young folks did what they could
to entertain themselves, the girls playing on the
piano in the hotel parlor, and the boys later on taking
them to the bowling alleys next door and initiating
them into the mysteries of the game. Dave
was a good bowler and so was Roger, each being
able occasionally to make a score of two hundred.
But Ben and Phil could not do much better
than one hundred, while none of the girls
got over eighty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that the snow has stopped falling, I suppose
we had better try to get back to Crumville,&rdquo;
said Laura to her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we ought to get back,&rdquo; put in Jessie.
&ldquo;I suppose our folks are dreadfully worried about
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too bad that you couldn&rsquo;t send some
sort of word,&rdquo; came from Belle. &ldquo;If you could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
only do that we could stay here until the roads
were well broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the West we don&rsquo;t pretend to go out in
such a storm,&rdquo; remarked Cora Dartmore. &ldquo;But,
of course, our distances are greater, and we have
so few landmarks that it is an easy thing to get
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we are going to get away from
here in any great hurry,&rdquo; replied Dave. &ldquo;It is
true the snow has stopped coming down and the
sun is breaking through the clouds; but I am quite
sure the drifts on the road between here and
Crumville are much higher than we can manage,
even with the powerful horses we have. We&rsquo;ll
have to wait until the roads are more or less
broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero was right about not getting away.
They went down to the stables and interviewed
Washington Bones and several of the other drivers
present, and all agreed that it would not be
possible to get very far beyond the town limits.
This news made the young folks chafe considerably,
but there was nothing to be done; so for another
day they had to content themselves as best
they could. During that time the boys did their
best to send some message to Crumville, but without
success, for all of the telephone and telegraph
wires were still down and nothing had been done
to mend them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></div>
<p>The next morning, however, things looked a
little brighter. The weather continued to improve,
and several horse teams, as well as an ox
team, came through on the road from the direction
of Crumville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road ain&rsquo;t none too good so far as I
could see,&rdquo; announced one of the drivers to Dave.
&ldquo;But if you take your time and watch where
you&rsquo;re going, maybe you can get through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let us try it anyway!&rdquo; cried Laura, who
was present. &ldquo;If we find we can&rsquo;t make it we
can come back here, or else stop at some other
place along the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was finally agreed that they should make the
effort, and they started about ten o&rsquo;clock. The
sun was shining with dazzling brilliancy on the
snow, and with no wind blowing it was considerably
warmer than it had been on the journey to
Lamont. All of the young folks were in good
humor, Dave for the time being dismissing from
his mind the trouble occasioned by the loss of his
cap and overcoat.</p>
<p>As they drove away from the town they could
see the effects of the great wind. In some spots
the road was almost bare of snow, while in others
there were drifts ten and twelve feet in height.
To drive through such drifts was, of course, impossible;
so they had to make long detours through
the surrounding fields. At such places the horses,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
of course, had to be driven with extra care, for
no one wanted the sleigh to land in some hole or
be overturned. Occasionally, when the turnout
was on a dangerous slant, the girls would shriek
and the boys would hold their breath; but each
time Washington Bones was equal to the occasion
and brought them through safely.</p>
<p>By noon they had covered five miles, and then
they stopped to rest at a village where all procured
a good hot dinner. Then they went forward
once again, this time through a long patch
of timber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we gits through dat, we&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo;
declared the colored driver.</p>
<p>The snow lay deep in the woods, but the horses
proved equal to the occasion, and at last the timber
was left behind and they came out on a ridge
road where the snow was only a few inches in
depth. Here they were able to make fairly good
time, so that three o&rsquo;clock found them almost
within sight of the outskirts of Crumville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make it easily,&rdquo; declared Ben.
But he proved to be mistaken, for a little distance
farther on they ran again into the deep snow and
had to pass around one drift after another, finally
going clear across several fields to another highway.
As a result it was well after dark before
they gained the road leading past the Wadsworth
jewelry works.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this looks like home, anyway,&rdquo; declared
Dave to Jessie, as he nodded in the direction of
her father&rsquo;s establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I&rsquo;m glad of it,&rdquo; returned the girl.
&ldquo;Gracious! it seems to me that we have been on
the road for a week!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can be thankful that we got through so
easily, Jessie. Wash is certainly some driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On account of another big drift they had to
pass to still another road, and this brought them
finally to the street leading past the Basswood
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all the same to you folks, I&rsquo;ll get off at
my place,&rdquo; announced Ben. &ldquo;I suppose my
father and mother are worrying about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Ben,&rdquo; returned Dave. And then
he added quickly: &ldquo;I trust you find your father
is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a flourish Washington Bones drew up the
panting horses in front of the Basswood place.
Just as Ben leaped from the sleigh the front door
of the house opened and Mrs. Basswood appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ben! Ben! is that you?&rdquo; cried the youth&rsquo;s
parent, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mother,&rdquo; he answered cheerily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
worry. I am all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forgetful that she had on only thin shoes, and
no covering over her head or shoulders, Mrs.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
Basswood ran directly down to the big sleigh.
She glanced over the occupants and her eyes fastened
instantly on Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave, have you been with Ben since you went
away?&rdquo; she queried. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t been to our
house?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name='TC_1'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was single quote">&ldquo;Why</ins> certainly I haven&rsquo;t been here, Mrs. Basswood,&rdquo;
he returned promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s true! It&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; she wailed,
wringing her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s true, Mother?&rdquo; demanded the son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The miniatures! They&rsquo;re gone! They
have been stolen! That young man who looks
like Dave was here and took them away!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>HOW THE MINIATURES DISAPPEARED</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The miniatures are gone?&rdquo; came from Ben
Basswood in astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ben, gone!&rdquo; and the mother wrung her
hands in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say Ward Porton dared to
come here and impersonate me and get them?&rdquo;
cried Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been that fellow, Dave. He
looked exactly like you. That is why I just asked
you if you had been to our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been with Ben and the others since
we went on our sleigh-ride,&rdquo; said our hero.
&ldquo;This is terrible! How did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come into the house and I&rsquo;ll tell you all about
it,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Basswood. Her face was
drawn with anxiety, and all could see that she was
suffering keenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how is father?&rdquo; questioned Ben, as the
party trooped up the piazza steps and into the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t so well, Ben, as he was before you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
went away. Oh, dear! and to think how easily I
was duped!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave had told Washington Bones to wait for
them, and, entering the parlor of the Basswood
home, the others listened to what the lady of the
house had to tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father had just had another bad turn,
and the nurse and I were doing what we could
for him when the door-bell rang,&rdquo; she began. &ldquo;I
went downstairs, and there stood somebody that
I thought was Dave. I asked him into the house
and he at once wanted to know how Mr. Basswood
was getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo; questioned Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was two days ago, and just about noon
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days ago!&rdquo; repeated Roger. &ldquo;Then
Porton must have come here right after leaving
the hotel in Lamont. How ever did he get
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he took that train that got through
from Pepsico,&rdquo; answered Phil. &ldquo;You remember
we heard that quite a few people made that train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hear about the miniatures,&rdquo; broke in
Ben, impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he came in, as I said, and asked about
Mr. Basswood&rsquo;s health. Then he told me that he
was in a great hurry&ndash;&ndash;that a certain famous art
critic had called on Mr. Wadsworth, and, having
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
heard about the Enos miniatures, was very anxious
to see them. He told me that the art critic
had thought of coming over with him, but Mr.
Wadsworth had said that it might disturb Mr.
Basswood too much to have the miniatures examined
in our house. The art critic did not want
to become snowbound in Crumville, so he was
only going to stay until the four o&rsquo;clock afternoon
train. The young man said Mr. Wadsworth
wanted to know if we would allow him to take
the miniatures over to the Wadsworth house, and
that he would bring them back safely, either that
evening or the next morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mother! didn&rsquo;t you suspect it might be
a trick?&rdquo; questioned Ben, anxiously. &ldquo;You
knew how this Ward Porton has been impersonating
Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Ben, I know,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Basswood,
again wringing her hands. &ldquo;And I should
have been more careful. But you know I was
very much upset on account of the bad turn your
father had had. Then, too, the young man threw
me off my guard by asking me if I had one of
those cards which Dave had distributed among the
storekeepers&ndash;&ndash;the one with his autograph on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said &lsquo;<a name='TC_2'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Removed extra double quote">no,&rsquo;</ins> but told him I was very well acquainted
with his handwriting. Then he said he
would write out a card for me, adding, with a
laugh, that he wanted me to be sure he was really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
Dave. He drew a blank card out of his pocket
and turned to a table to write on it and then
handed it to me. Here is the card now;&rdquo; and,
going to the mantelpiece, the lady of the house
produced it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the cards that I left in the overcoat
that was stolen!&rdquo; exclaimed Dave. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t
write this at all, Mrs. Basswood. That rascal
stole my overcoat and some of these cards were in
it. He simply pretended to write on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was sure it was your handwriting,
and that made me feel easy about the fellow being
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you knew I was with Ben and the others
on the sleigh-ride,&rdquo; broke in Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I forgot to state that when he came in he
explained that you were all stormbound at the
hotel in Lamont and that, as the telephone and
telegraph wires were all down, he had managed
to get to Pepsico and reach Crumville on a freight
train, doing this so that we and the Wadsworths
would not worry, thinking the sleighing-party had
been lost somewhere on the road in this awful
blizzard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then you gave him the miniatures?&rdquo;
questioned Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. Oh, Ben, I know now how very foolish
it was! But I was so upset! At first I
thought to ask your father about it; but I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
afraid that to disturb him would make him feel
worse, and I knew he was bad enough already.
Then, too, I knew that Mr. Wadsworth was expecting
some art critics to look at the miniatures,
so I concluded it must be all right. I have always
known the combination of your father&rsquo;s safe,
so it was an easy matter for me to open it and
get the miniatures out. I told the young man to
be careful of them, and he told me not to worry&ndash;&ndash;that
the miniatures would be perfectly safe,
and that Mr. Wadsworth had promised to get
the critic to set a fair value on each of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this Ward Porton alone?&rdquo; asked Laura.
The girls, of course, had listened with as much interest
as the boys to what the lady of the house
had to relate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he came in a cutter driven by a man who
was so bundled up because of the cold that I could
not make out who he was. As soon as I gave him
the cases containing the miniatures the young man
hurried off in the cutter, stating that the sooner
the critic had a chance to see the paintings the
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened next?&rdquo; questioned Dave,
as Mrs. Basswood paused in her recital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went back to assist a nurse who had come in,
and all that night we had our hands full with my
husband. We had to call in the doctor, and he
was really not out of danger until noon of the next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
day. I had wanted to tell him about sending the
miniatures over to the Wadsworth house, but he
was in no condition to be told anything, so I kept
silent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But didn&rsquo;t you get worried when noon came
and the supposed Dave didn&rsquo;t return with them?&rdquo;
questioned the son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as soon as the doctor said that your
father was out of danger I began to worry over
the miniatures. I waited until the middle of the
afternoon, and then, although it was snowing and
blowing something awful, I hailed a passing man&ndash;&ndash;old
Joe Patterson&ndash;&ndash;and asked him if he would
go on an errand to the Wadsworth house. He
said he would try to make it for a dollar, and so I
wrote a short note to Mrs. Wadsworth, knowing
that she must be at home even though her husband
and Dave might be away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Patterson delivered this message, and
Mrs. Wadsworth sent back word that she had not
seen anything of Dave since he had gone away on
the sleigh-ride, nor had she seen anything of the
miniatures. She added that her husband had
gone to the jewelry works, but that she would send
one of the hired men after him at once and acquaint
him with the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do then?&rdquo; went on Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really didn&rsquo;t know what to do. Your father
was so ill that the nurse and I had to give him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
every attention. I was waiting for the doctor to
come again, but he could not get here on account
of the snow-drifts. Mr. Wadsworth put in an
appearance about two hours later, and then I told
him just what I have told you. He declared at
once that it must be a trick, stating that Dave had
not been near the house since going away with all
of you young folks. Mr. Wadsworth was quite
put out, and wanted to know how it was that I had
not been able to detect the deception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; commenced Ben, and
then stopped short, for he could see how his
mother was suffering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Ben, I know what you were going to
say,&rdquo; she broke in quickly. &ldquo;Having known
Dave so many years I should have discovered the
deception. But, as I said before, I was terribly
worked up over your father&rsquo;s condition. Then,
too, the young man came in bundled up in an overcoat
and a cap that looked exactly like those Dave
wears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were mine. That fellow stole them
from me,&rdquo; interrupted our hero, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only that, but he had a tippet placed over
his head and around his neck, and he spoke in a
very hoarse voice, stating that he had caught a
terrible cold while on the sleigh-ride and while
coming back to Crumville on the freight train.
He spoke about Mr. Basswood&rsquo;s real estate business,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
and about Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth and
Jessie, and so many other things that we are familiar
with, that I was completely deceived. Then,
too, his turning over that written card to me also
threw me off my guard. But I know I was very
foolish, very foolish indeed!&rdquo; and Mrs. Basswood&rsquo;s
lips trembled and she wrung her hands
once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Mr. Wadsworth do?&rdquo; questioned
Dave, in the midst of rather an awkward pause.
He agreed with Ben that Mrs. Basswood should
have recognized Ward Porton as an imposter, but
he did not want to say anything that might add to
the lady&rsquo;s misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he would set the authorities at work
and see if he could not find Porton and his confederate.
I was so bewildered that I&ndash;&ndash;well, I
might as well admit it&ndash;&ndash;I told him that I couldn&rsquo;t
understand how I had been deceived, and that
maybe Dave had gotten the miniatures after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Basswood, you didn&rsquo;t really mean
that!&rdquo; cried our hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so bewildered I didn&rsquo;t know what I
meant, Dave. That young man did look so very
much like you. That&rsquo;s the reason, when you folks
drove up to the house, I ran out to ask if you had
really been here or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything of this Ward Porton
since?&rdquo; asked Roger.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t heard anything. Whether Mr.
Wadsworth has learned anything or not I do not
know, for he has not been here and the storm has
been so awful, with all the telephone wires down,
that I could not send for news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does father know about this now?&rdquo; questioned
Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ben, I have not had the courage to tell
him,&rdquo; answered the mother. &ldquo;I told the doctor,
and he advised that I say nothing for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d tell him,&rdquo; said Dave. &ldquo;I
think the best thing we can do is to try to follow
Porton and this fellow with him and get back the
miniatures. Then it will be time enough to tell
Mr. Basswood about the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as they had entered the parlor the lady
of the house had shut the door, so that none of
the conversation might reach the sick chamber
overhead. In reply to numerous questions Mrs.
Basswood gave all the details as to how the rascally
Porton had been able to gain possession of
the miniatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll hurry up and get home,&rdquo; declared
Dave, presently. &ldquo;I want to hear what Mr.
Wadsworth has to say; and also find out what
he and my folks have done towards getting on the
track of Porton and his confederate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; exclaimed Roger. &ldquo;Say!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
but this is the worst yet, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; He turned to
the lady of the house. &ldquo;I am awfully sorry for
you, Mrs. Basswood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we are all sorry,&rdquo; broke in our hero,
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope they catch that Porton and put him
in prison!&rdquo; cried Jessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is where he belongs,&rdquo; answered Dave,
soberly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>A VAIN SEARCH</h3>
</div>
<p>To find out what Mr. Wadsworth, as well as
Dave&rsquo;s father and his uncle, had done, Ben accompanied
the other young folks to the jewelry
manufacturer&rsquo;s mansion. They found that Mr.
Wadsworth had gone to business, but the other
men were present and were much interested in
what Dave and his chums had to relate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done all we could to get the authorities
on the trail of Ward Porton,&rdquo; announced
Dave&rsquo;s father; &ldquo;but we have been much hindered
on account of this awful blizzard. The telegraph
and telephone wires are down in all directions, so
it has been practically impossible to send word any
great distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With such a storm it may be possible that Porton
and his confederate are still in Crumville,&rdquo;
suggested Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hardly think that,&rdquo; said Dunston Porter.
&ldquo;More than likely they did everything they could
to put distance between themselves and this town
after they got their hands on the miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you know we found out that Porton&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
confederate managed to get a horse and cutter
from Bryson&rsquo;s livery stable,&rdquo; said Dave&rsquo;s
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we didn&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; cried Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s true. The confederate, who gave
his name as Frank Carson, said he wanted the
turnout to go for a doctor. He said he had been
sent by Mr. Jamison, the minister. Of course, it
was all a trick and Mr. Jamison knew absolutely
nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they return the horse and cutter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did not. And Bryson is mourning the
loss of a good horse. The cutter he says did not
amount to so much. He would not have let the
animal go out, only the fellow begged so hard,
stating that it was practically a case of life or death&ndash;&ndash;and
he offered to pay double money for the
horse&rsquo;s use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they seen at all?&rdquo; questioned Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! A number of people who were
stormbound saw them pass down the street and
stop at your house. Then others saw the cutter
turn in the direction of Hacklebury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you tried to follow?&rdquo; queried
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did that,&rdquo; answered Dunston Porter. &ldquo;It
was tough work getting through as far as the mill
town. But I managed it, and made all sorts of
inquiries. Two people had seen the cutter pass
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
the mills, but no one could give me any definite information
as to which way it headed after that.
You see, it was growing dark by that time, and the
snow was coming down so thickly that it was next
to impossible to see any great distance in any direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we know they went as far as Hacklebury,
and that&rsquo;s something,&rdquo; returned Phil hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it isn&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; came in a rather hopeless
tone from Ben. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;ve got
away and we&rsquo;ll never see them again, or the miniatures
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that, Ben!&rdquo; cried Laura, sympathetically.
&ldquo;Pictures, you know, are not like
money. Porton and that rascal with him will have
no easy time disposing of the miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what they may do!&rdquo; burst out
Jessie, suddenly. &ldquo;They may go to some big city
and then send you word that they will return the
miniatures provided you will pay them a certain
amount of money for so doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! I believe that&rsquo;s just what they will do!&rdquo;
cried Dave. &ldquo;Jessie, I think you&rsquo;ve struck the
nail right on the head!&rdquo; and he looked at the girl
admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope they do that&ndash;&ndash;if we don&rsquo;t catch
them,&rdquo; returned Ben. &ldquo;If those miniatures are
worth anything like a hundred thousand dollars, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
guess my dad would be glad enough to give five
or ten thousand dollars to get them back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t give up the hunt yet, Ben,&rdquo; urged
Roger. &ldquo;Just as soon as this awful storm is
over I&rsquo;d let the authorities in all the big cities, as
well as the little ones, know about the theft, and
then they can be on the watch for Porton and his
confederate. By the way, I wonder who the confederate
can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rdquo; answered
the real estate dealer&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>With the disappearance of the Basswood fortune
in their minds, neither the young folks nor
the grown folks could talk about much else.
Laura and Jessie told the latter&rsquo;s mother how they
had fallen in with Dr. Renwick and his wife, and
how the pair had looked after the girls during their
stay at the Lamont Hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nice of Mrs. Renwick to do that,&rdquo; said
the lady of the mansion; &ldquo;but it is no more than
I would expect from her. She is a very estimable
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was rather hard for Dave and Roger to settle
down to their studies on the following morning,
but there was nothing they could do to help along
the search for those who had taken the miniatures,
and, as both youths were anxious to make up for
lost time, they applied themselves as diligently as
possible.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>Mr. Ramsdell had been away, but the tutor
came back that afternoon, and the two students
put in a full day over their books, leaving Laura,
Jessie and Phil to look after the visitors from the
West.</p>
<p>The blizzard had now ceased entirely, and by
the end of the week all the roads in the vicinity of
Crumville were fairly well broken and some of the
telegraph and telephone lines had been repaired.
The newspapers came in from the larger cities,
and it was found that the blizzard had covered a
wide area of the country, extending practically
from the Mississippi River to the Atlantic seaboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s given Ward Porton and his confederate a
dandy chance to get away,&rdquo; was Roger&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Roger,&rdquo; answered Dave.
&ldquo;And so far it would seem that they have left no
trace behind them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Ben it was learned that Mr. Basswood
was slowly improving in health. He had asked
about the miniatures, and the art critics who were
to have visited Crumville on the invitation of Mr.
Wadsworth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t keep the news from him any
longer,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;When he asked about the
pictures my mother broke down and had to confess
that she had let Porton take them, thinking he
was Dave. Of course, father was very much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
disturbed, and the doctor had to pay an extra visit
and give him something to keep him quiet. I
told him that all of us were doing everything we
possibly could to get on the track of the thieves,
and now he is resting in the hope that sooner or
later the miniatures will be recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The loss of the miniatures had taken a good
deal of the fun out of Ben, and when the young
folks stopping at the Wadsworth mansion went
out sleighing again, and for some fun skating, he
begged to be excused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take the loss too hard, Ben,&rdquo; said
Dave, quietly. &ldquo;Remember, if the worse comes
to the worst, you are just as well off as you were
before you heard of this Enos fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, Dave. But it makes me mad to
think that we had such a fortune as that right in
our hands and then let it get away from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your mother feels dreadfully about
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly does, Dave. Why, she isn&rsquo;t
herself at all. Sometimes I think that her worrying
will bring on a regular fit of sickness. She, of
course, thinks that it is entirely her fault that the
miniatures are gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to do all you can to cheer her
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m doing that! And I do what I can to
cheer up my father too. Just the same, I&rsquo;m
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
mighty blue myself at times;&rdquo; and the real estate
dealer&rsquo;s son heaved a deep sigh.</p>
<p>At last came the day when Belle and Cora must
return to their homes in the West. On the evening
before, Jessie and Laura gave a little party
in their honor, which was attended by over a score
of the boys and girls of Crumville. The young
people played games, sang, and danced to their
hearts&rsquo; content, and Mrs. Wadsworth saw to it
that ample refreshments were served to all.</p>

<span class='smcap'>The young people played games, sang, and danced to their hearts&rsquo; content</span>.&ndash;&ndash;<i>Page 169.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve had a perfectly lovely time!&rdquo; declared
Belle, when she and the others were on their
way to the depot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so have I had a lovely time,&rdquo; added Cora
Dartmore. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m so sorry your friend lost
that fortune,&rdquo; she added. Ben had said good-bye
over the telephone, the wire of which was once
more in working order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ever do hear of those miniatures you
must let us know,&rdquo; went on Belle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be sure to do that,&rdquo; answered Laura.
And then the train came in, and, with a final handshake
all around, and with several kisses exchanged
between the girls, Belle and Cora climbed
on board, Dave and Phil assisting them with their
suitcases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I&rsquo;m not going with you,&rdquo; cried the
shipowner&rsquo;s son, &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve promised Dave and
Roger to stay a few days longer.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure to send us a letter as soon as you get
back home,&rdquo; cried Jessie.</p>
<p>And then the train rolled out of the station and
the visitors from the West were gone.</p>
<p>On the night before Phil took his departure the
three chums had what they called a &ldquo;talk-fest&rdquo;
in Dave&rsquo;s room. They spoke about many things&ndash;&ndash;of
how they had first gone to Oak Hall, and of
various adventures that had occurred since that
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Oak Hall boys are becoming scattered,&rdquo;
said Phil. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose they&rsquo;ll ever all get
together again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll have to meet at some future graduation
exercises at the Hall!&rdquo; cried Dave. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t think of letting such fellows as Shadow
Hamilton, Buster Beggs, and Sam Day drop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are!&rdquo; came from Roger. &ldquo;If I
can get there at all you can count on my going back
to Oak Hall whenever there are any commencement
exercises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I half wish I was going into this civil engineering
business with you two fellows,&rdquo; continued
Phil. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not cut out for that
sort of thing. I love the sea and everything connected
with ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows you&rsquo;re a chip of the old block,&rdquo;
announced Dave, clapping his chum on the shoulder.
&ldquo;You take after your father, Phil, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
don&rsquo;t think you could do better than to follow him
in his shipping business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do follow him in that business, I tell you
what you&rsquo;ve got to do,&rdquo; announced the shipowner&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;Some time you&rsquo;ve both got to take a nice
big cruise with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would suit me down to the shoe-tips,&rdquo;
returned Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be fine, Phil,&rdquo; answered Dave.
&ldquo;But just at present, Roger and I have got to bone
to beat the band if we want to pass that examination.
You must remember that being away from
home on account of that blizzard put us behind
quite a good deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you won&rsquo;t have me to worry you after
to-night,&rdquo; grinned the chum. &ldquo;Starting to-morrow
morning you and Roger can put in twenty-four
hours a day over your studies, as far as I
am concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! Listen to that! He&rsquo;s as considerate
as old Job Haskers used to be,&rdquo; exclaimed the
senator&rsquo;s son. And then, picking up a pillow, he
shied it at Phil&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Another pillow was sent at Roger in return; and
in a moment a so-called &ldquo;Oak Hall pillow fight&rdquo;
was in full progress in the room, pillows, blankets,
books, and various other objects flying in all directions.
Then Phil got Roger down on one of
the beds and was promptly hauled off by Dave,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
and in a moment more the three youths were rolling
over and over on the floor.</p>
<p>Suddenly there sounded a knock on the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Who is that?&rdquo; cried Dave; and at
once the three youths scrambled to their feet, readjusting
their clothing as they did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave, such a noise!&rdquo; came from his
sister. &ldquo;What in the world are you doing in
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are only bidding Phil good-bye,&rdquo; answered
the brother, sweetly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>THE CIVIL ENGINEERING EXAMINATION</h3>
</div>
<p>As the days went by, and Dave and Roger continued
to prepare themselves for the examination
which was rapidly approaching, the authorities did
all they could to locate Ward Porton and his confederate.
Diligent inquiries were made concerning
the identity of the man who had occupied the
room at Lamont with the former moving-picture
actor, and it was finally discovered that he was
Tim Crapsey, a fellow already wanted by the
police for several crimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer that a fellow like Porton should
throw in his fortunes with a man like Crapsey,&rdquo;
was Roger&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;From all accounts Crapsey
is a thoroughly good-for-nothing fellow with a
great liking for strong drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows Porton&rsquo;s real disposition, Roger,&rdquo;
answered Dave. &ldquo;If he were any kind of a
clean-minded or decent fellow he wouldn&rsquo;t want to
put up with such a vile fellow as this Tim Crapsey
is represented by the police to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Crapsey is already known to the police they
ought to be able to locate him sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Those slick criminals have a way all their own
for keeping out of sight of the police.&rdquo; Dave
paused for a moment. &ldquo;Do you know I&rsquo;ve been
thinking of something. Maybe this fellow, Crapsey,
simply used Porton as a tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in this way: when they heard about the
miniatures, and Crapsey heard how much Porton
looked like me, and how intimate I and the Wadsworths
were with the Basswoods, it may have been
Crapsey who concocted the scheme for getting
possession of the miniatures. And if he did that,
it is more than likely that he will be the one to
dispose of the pictures or send in an offer to return
them for a certain amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean and cut Ward Porton out of the
deal?&rdquo; questioned the senator&rsquo;s son, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may not cut Porton out entirely. But the
chances are that he&rsquo;ll let Porton have as little of
the returns as possible. A professional criminal
like this Crapsey isn&rsquo;t going to let an amateur like
Porton in on the ground floor if he can help it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll do Porton out of it entirely.
Wouldn&rsquo;t that make the moving-picture actor
mad!&rdquo; and Roger grinned over the thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is no more than Porton would deserve,&rdquo;
answered our hero. &ldquo;Just the same, I hope the
authorities capture them both and return the miniatures
to Mr. Basswood.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></div>
<p>Two days before the time when Dave and
Roger were to undergo the much talked-of examination
in civil engineering, there came news from
a country town fifteen miles beyond Hacklebury.
A livery stableman there sent in word that he was
boarding a horse which he thought might be the
one stolen from Mr. Bryson. The Crumville
liveryman at once notified Ben and the local police,
and the boy and an officer accompanied him to
Centertown. Mr. Bryson at once recognized the
horse as his own, and wanted to know how the
Centertown liveryman had become possessed of
the animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was left here by a man I think was this
Tim Crapsey the paper spoke about,&rdquo; announced
the livery stable keeper. &ldquo;He said he was on the
road to the next town, but that the storm was too
much for him, and that he wanted to leave the
animal with me for a few days or a week. He
said he was rather short of cash and asked me to
lend him ten dollars, which, of course, I did, as I
thought the horse was ample security,&rdquo; went on the
livery stableman, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was the fellow alone?&rdquo; was the question
which Ben put.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came in alone, but I think after he left
the stable he was joined by another fellow down
on the corner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Centertown livery-stable keeper had not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
noticed where Crapsey and his companion had
gone, but thought they had made their way to the
railroad station. It was learned that a train
bound for New York City had left Centertown
about an hour later. All came to the conclusion
that Ward Porton and Tim Crapsey had taken
this. The train had been stalled some hours along
the road, but had finally reached the Grand Central
Terminal of the metropolis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this proves one thing&ndash;&ndash;that Porton
and Crapsey got as far as New York City with the
miniatures,&rdquo; said Dave, when he heard the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and New York is such a large place, with
so many people in it, that it will be almost impossible
for the authorities to trace them there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, Roger&ndash;&ndash;especially when you remember
that this happened some time ago, so that
by now the thieves may be in Chicago, San Francisco,
or in London, Paris, or some other far-away
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last came the time when Dave and Roger
were to go in for the examination which meant so
much to them. They had worked hard, and Mr.
Ramsdell had assisted them in every way possible;
yet both were rather doubtful over the outcome
of the affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t going to be like the examinations at
Oak Hall,&rdquo; said our hero. &ldquo;Mr. Ramsdell admitted
that it would be stiff from the word go.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; answered the senator&rsquo;s son.
&ldquo;It seems that several years ago they were a little
lax, and, as a consequence, some fellows slipped
through that had no right to pass. Now they
have jacked the examiners up, so that the test is
likely to be fierce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! what are you going to do if you
don&rsquo;t pass?&rdquo; cried Jessie, when he was ready to
leave home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t pass now, Jessie, I&rsquo;ll simply go at
my studies again and keep at them until I do pass,&rdquo;
he answered.</p>
<p>The examination which was held in the city was
divided into two parts, one taking place from ten
to twelve in the morning, and the other from two
to five in the afternoon. There were about thirty
students present, and as far as possible each was
separated from any friends he might have on
hand, so that Dave sat on one side of the hall in
which the examination occurred and the senator&rsquo;s
son sat on the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how did you make out?&rdquo; questioned
Roger of Dave, when the two went out for their
midday lunch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, Roger,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;I think, however, that I answered at least seventy
per cent, of the questions correctly. How
about yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m hoping that I got seventy per cent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
of them right,&rdquo; returned the senator&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;But
maybe I didn&rsquo;t get above fifty or sixty per cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The afternoon questions seemed to be much
harder than those of the morning. The students
were given until five o&rsquo;clock to pass in their afternoon
papers, and never did Dave and Roger work
harder than they did during the final hour. One
question in particular bothered our hero a great
deal. But at almost the last minute the answer to
it came like an inspiration, and he dashed it down.
This question proved a poser for the senator&rsquo;s
son, and he passed in his paper without attempting
to put down a solution.</p>
<p>Following that examination, Dave returned to
Crumville. Roger journeyed to Washington,
where his folks were staying at a leading hotel,
Congress being in session and Senator Morr occupying
his place in the Senate.</p>
<p>There was a week of anxious waiting, and then
one day Dave received an official-looking envelope
which made his heart beat rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Dave?&rdquo; cried his sister, when she
saw him with the letter in his hand. &ldquo;Is it your
civil engineering report?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is, Laura,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave, how I hope you&rsquo;ve passed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; put in Jessie.</p>
<p>Dave could not give an answer to this, because,
for the moment, his heart seemed to be in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
throat. Passing to the desk in the library, he slit
open the envelope and took out the sheet which it
contained. A single glance at it, and he gave a
shout of triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve passed!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, good!&rdquo; came simultaneously from his
sister and Jessie. And then they crowded closer
to look at the sheet of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it say what percentage you got?&rdquo; continued
his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, as near as I can make out, I&rsquo;ve got a
standing of ninety-two per cent.,&rdquo; he announced,
with pardonable pride. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that fine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the finest ever, Dave!&rdquo; said his sister,
fondly, as she threw her arms around his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave, it&rsquo;s just glorious!&rdquo; exclaimed
Jessie, her eyes beaming. And when he caught
her and held her tight for a moment she offered
no resistance. &ldquo;Oh, won&rsquo;t your father and your
uncle be proud when they hear of this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell them right now!&rdquo; he cried,
and ran off to spread the good news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, I&rsquo;m proud of you,&rdquo; said his father.
&ldquo;Proud of you!&rdquo; and he clapped Dave affectionately
on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect anything different from our
Davy,&rdquo; put in Uncle Dunston. &ldquo;I knew he&rsquo;d
pass. Well, now you&rsquo;ve passed, I wish you every
success in the profession you have chosen.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not a full-fledged civil engineer yet,
Uncle Dunston,&rdquo; broke in Dave, quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a whole lot to learn yet. Remember this is
only my first examination. I&rsquo;ve got to study a
whole lot more and have a whole lot of practice,
too, before I can graduate as a real civil engineer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave lost no time in sending a telegram to
Roger. In return, a few hours later came word
from the senator&rsquo;s son that he, too, had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; cried Dave, once more, and then
could not resist the temptation to grab Jessie about
the waist and start on a mad dance through the
library, the hallway, the dining-room, and the
living room of the mansion. Mrs. Wadsworth
looked on and smiled indulgently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose your heart is as light as a feather
now, Dave,&rdquo; she said, when the impromptu whirl
came to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is, Mrs. Wadsworth,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;Passing that examination has lifted a tremendous
weight from my shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course Mr. Ramsdell was greatly pleased to
think that both of his pupils had passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I can write to my friends of the Mentor
Construction Company and see if they can give
Dave and Roger an opening,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They
promised it to me some time ago in case the boys
passed.&rdquo; And he set about sending off a letter
without delay.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>OFF FOR TEXAS</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Glorious news!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! have you heard from Mr. Ramsdell?&rdquo;
cried his sister Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here is a letter. And it enclosed another
from the Mentor Construction Company.
They are going to give me an opening with that
portion of the concern that is now operating in
Texas, building railroad bridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! then you will really have to go
away down there?&rdquo; burst out Jessie, her face
falling a trifle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dreadfully long way
off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s what I expected,&rdquo; he answered.
&ldquo;A fellow can&rsquo;t expect to become a civil engineer
and work in his own backyard,&rdquo; and he grinned
a trifle. &ldquo;This letter from Mr. Ramsdell states
that Roger will be given an opening also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With you, of course?&rdquo; queried Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t state that. But he knew we
wanted to stick together, so I suppose it&rsquo;s all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;When do you have to start?&rdquo; questioned
Jessie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as soon as we can get ready&ndash;&ndash;according
to Mr. Ramsdell&rsquo;s letter. He says he is also
sending word to Roger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As was to be expected, the tidings quite excited
our hero. Now that he had passed the preliminary
examination and was to go out for actual
field practice, he felt that he was really and truly
on his way to becoming a civil engineer. It was
the first step towards the realization of a dream
that had been his for some time.</p>
<p>Dave&rsquo;s father and his uncle, as well as Mr. and
Mrs. Wadsworth, were greatly interested in the
news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing about it, Dave,&rdquo; said
his parent; &ldquo;I have made a number of inquiries,
and have learned that the Mentor Construction
Company is one of the largest and finest in this
country. They employ a number of first-class
engineers; so it is likely that you will receive the
very best of instruction, and I sincerely hope that
you will make the best of your opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to do my level best, Dad,&rdquo; he returned
earnestly. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m a mighty lucky
boy,&rdquo; he added, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you owe Mr. Ramsdell a good deal,&rdquo;
said his Uncle Dunston. &ldquo;Of course, we have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
paid him for his services, but that isn&rsquo;t everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; Dave returned; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m either
going to thank him in person or else send him the
nicest letter that I can write.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that he was really going to leave home,
Mrs. Wadsworth, as well as Laura and Jessie,
took it upon their shoulders to see that Dave
should be properly taken care of so far as wearing
apparel went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But oh, Dave! it&rsquo;s awful to think of your going
so far away!&rdquo; said Jessie, one day, when the
two were alone in the library. &ldquo;The house will
be dreadfully lonely after you are gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be much different from when I was
at Oak Hall, Jessie,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, it will be, Dave. Texas is a long
way off. And my father says the construction
work that the Mentor Company is doing is close
to the Mexican border. What if you should have
trouble with some of those awful Mexican
bandits?&rdquo; and the girl shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect any trouble of that kind.
Practically all the fighting that has been going
on has been on Mexican soil on the other side of
the Rio Grande. As I understand it, the nearest
point that the Mentor Construction Company
reaches to Mexico is some miles from the border.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s close enough with so much fighting
going on,&rdquo; Jessie pouted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any
of those awful Mexican revolutionists to fire at
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Jessie,&rdquo; Dave answered; and
then caught her by both hands and drew her closer.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to write to me regularly, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; he continued, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, Dave! And don&rsquo;t you forget to
answer every letter,&rdquo; she replied quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll do that, never fear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you really think you are going to enjoy
becoming a civil engineer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m positive of it, Jessie. The more I see
of the profession, the more I am in love with it.
It&rsquo;s a wonderful thing. Just think of being able
to plan out a great big bridge across a broad river,
or some wonderful dam, or a tall sky-scraper, or
an elevated railroad, or a tunnel under a gigantic
mountain, or a tube under some river, or&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my gracious me, Dave! are you going
to do all those wonderful things?&rdquo; gasped the
girl, her eyes opening widely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect I&rsquo;ll ever have the chance to do
all those things, Jessie; but I&rsquo;m going to try my
best to do some of them. Of course, you must remember
that at the present time civil engineering
is divided into a great many branches. Now, for
instance, I didn&rsquo;t mention anything about mining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
engineering, and that&rsquo;s a wonderful profession in
itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! it&rsquo;s wonderful&ndash;&ndash;simply wonderful!&rdquo;
cried the girl. &ldquo;And you are going to be
a wonderful man&ndash;&ndash;I know it!&rdquo; and she looked
earnestly into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I ever do get to be a wonderful man, it&rsquo;s
going to be on your account, Jessie,&rdquo; he returned
in a low voice. &ldquo;You have been my inspiration.
Don&rsquo;t forget that;&rdquo; and he drew her closer than
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true, Jessie. And I only hope that I&rsquo;ll
make good&ndash;&ndash;and that too before I am very much
older. Then I think you already know what I
am going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she whispered, and dropped her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to ask your folks for your hand
in marriage,&rdquo; he continued firmly, reading his answer
in her face.</p>
<p>Word had come in from Roger that he too was
getting ready to go to Texas, and that both of
the youths were to work together, as had been
anticipated. As the senator&rsquo;s son was in Washington,
it was arranged that Dave was to join him
in the Capitol City, and then the two were to
journey to Texas.</p>
<p>Ben had heard about Dave&rsquo;s proposed departure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
for the South, and he came over several times
to see his former Oak Hall chum before the latter
left home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news regarding the miniatures?&rdquo; questioned
Dave, during the last of these visits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; answered the real estate dealer&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;The police thought they had one or
two clues, but they have all turned out to be false.
They arrested one fellow in Pittsburgh, thinking
he was Tim Crapsey, but he turned out to be somebody
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they haven&rsquo;t any word at all about
Ward Porton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that rascal seems to have disappeared
from the face of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is your father getting along, Ben?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t doing so well, Dave. This loss of
the miniatures was a terrible blow to him. You
see, the real estate business lately has not been
quite as good as it might be. My father went
into several pretty heavy investments, and he
needed a little more money to help him through.
So when he got word about this fortune in pictures,
he at once thought that he could sell some of
the miniatures and use the proceeds in his real
estate deals. Now that end of the business is
at a standstill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your father actually suffering for the want
of some cash?&rdquo; asked our hero, quickly. &ldquo;If
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
he is, I think my father or my Uncle Dunston can
help him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father has already promised to assist
him, and so has Mr. Wadsworth, Dave. But that
isn&rsquo;t the thing. You know my father is an independent
sort of man, and it worries him to think
that he can&rsquo;t stand entirely on his own feet in his
real estate transactions. Of course, if he were
well enough to be around I suppose he could adjust
matters without any special assistance. But
it&rsquo;s hard lines when things go wrong and you are
flat on your back in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can understand that. And it must
worry your mother, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it does! Ma isn&rsquo;t the same woman.
She is awfully pale and quite thin. The doctor
told her not to worry so, or she&rsquo;d be down on
her back, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to do what you can to cheer
up both of them.&rdquo; Dave drew a long breath.
&ldquo;I do wish somebody would catch those two rascals,
not only on your account but on my account
also. I&rsquo;d like to settle matters with Porton, for
having impersonated me at those stores, and for
taking my cap and overcoat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve offered a reward of five thousand dollars
for the return of the miniatures, and another
thousand each for the capture of the thieves,&rdquo;
announced Ben. &ldquo;That ought to be a strong inducement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
for the detectives to do all they possibly
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought you might possibly get an offer
from Porton or Crapsey, or both of them, to return
the miniatures for a certain amount,&rdquo; went
on Dave. &ldquo;But you say no such offer has come
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would your father consider it if it did come
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he would do, Dave. Of
course, he&rsquo;d hate to give up money to a thief;
but, just the same, he&rsquo;d hate it worse if he never
got the miniatures back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last came the time for Dave to leave home.
His trunk had been packed and shipped on ahead.
There was still considerable snow on the ground;
so he was taken to the depot in the big Wadsworth
sleigh, the girls and his father accompanying
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Davy, my boy!&rdquo; cried his Uncle
Dunston, when he was ready to leave the house.
&ldquo;Now I expect you to give a good account of
yourself while with that construction company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do keep away from the Mexicans,&rdquo;
added Mrs. Wadsworth with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You trust David to do the right thing,&rdquo; came
from old Caspar Potts, his mellow eyes beaming
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
brightly. &ldquo;David is all right. He&rsquo;s my boy,
and I&rsquo;m proud of him,&rdquo; and he nodded his head
over and over again.</p>
<p>For the girls, the drive to the depot was all too
short. Laura had so many things to say to her
brother that she hardly knew what to speak of
first. As for poor Jessie, she felt so bad she could
scarcely speak, and when she looked at Dave there
were unbidden tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t look at it that way,&rdquo; David whispered,
when he caught sight of the tears. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
be back again before a great while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave, I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;ca&ndash;&ndash;can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;I&ndash;&ndash;I&ndash;&ndash;think so&ndash;&ndash;so&ndash;&ndash;much
of&ndash;&ndash;of&ndash;&ndash;you!&rdquo; and then, for the moment, she
hid her face on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Mr. Porter had a few words of advice to give,
and he had hardly finished when the train rolled
into the station. Then Dave shook hands with
his father, and kissed each of the girls, and
climbed on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my son!&rdquo; called Mr. Porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Dad! Take care of yourself
while I&rsquo;m gone,&rdquo; he shouted back. &ldquo;Good-bye,
Laura! Good-bye, Jessie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Dave!&rdquo; returned the sister, waving
her hand.</p>
<p>Jessie tried to speak but could not, and so she
too waved a farewell.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>Then the train rolled from the Crumville station,
slowly gathering speed, and finally disappearing
in the distance.</p>
<p>At last our hero was off to become a full-fledged
civil engineer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>IN NEW YORK CITY</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dave Porter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buster Beggs!&rdquo; cried our hero, his face lighting
up. &ldquo;Where in the world did you come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just got off the accommodation coming the
other way,&rdquo; announced Joseph Beggs, otherwise
known as Buster, a fat youth who had long been
one of Dave&rsquo;s Oak Hall classmates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you alone?&rdquo; questioned our hero. He
had just stepped from the local train to change to
the express for New York City; and he had fairly
run into Buster, who was standing on the platform
flanked by several suitcases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not alone,&rdquo; answered the fat youth.
&ldquo;Shadow Hamilton and Luke Watson are with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so!&rdquo; and our hero&rsquo;s face
showed his pleasure. &ldquo;Are you bound for New
York?&rdquo; he questioned quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are going to take the express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! I am going there myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Got a seat in the parlor car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Number twelve, car two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that wonderful! We have eleven, thirteen
and fourteen!&rdquo; answered Buster Beggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there, Dave Porter!&rdquo; shouted another
youth, as he stepped out of the waiting-room of
the depot. &ldquo;How are you anyway?&rdquo; and he
came up, swinging a banjo-case from his right
hand to his left so that he might shake hands.
Luke Watson had always been one of the favorite
musicians at Oak Hall, playing the banjo and the
guitar very nicely, and singing well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty glad to see you, Luke!&rdquo; cried Dave,
and wrung the extended hand with such vigor that
the former musician of Oak Hall winced. Then
Dave looked over the other&rsquo;s shoulder and saw a
third lad approaching&ndash;&ndash;a youth who was as thin
as he was tall. &ldquo;How is our little boy, Shadow,
to-day?&rdquo; he continued, as Maurice Hamilton
came closer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! Am I blind or is it really Dave
Porter?&rdquo; burst out Shadow Hamilton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not blind, Shadow, and it&rsquo;s really
yours truly,&rdquo; laughed Dave. And then as another
handshake followed he continued: &ldquo;What
are you going down to New York City for? To
pick up some new stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick up stories?&rdquo; queried the former story
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
teller of Oak Hall, in perplexity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have
to pick them up. I have&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About fourteen million stories in pickle,&rdquo;
broke in Buster Beggs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen million!&rdquo; snorted Luke Watson.
&ldquo;You had better say about fourteen! Shadow
tells the same stories over and over again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that puts me in mind of a story!&rdquo; cried
the youth mentioned, his face lighting up.
&ldquo;Once on a time there was a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my, Shadow! are you going to start right
away?&rdquo; demanded Dave, with a broad grin on
his face. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give a fellow a chance to
catch his breath? This is a great surprise&ndash;&ndash;meeting
you three on my way to the city. And
to think we are going to be together in one of
the parlor cars, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can&rsquo;t lose the Oak Hall boys!&rdquo; cried
Buster. &ldquo;Say, let me tell you something,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;Luke has written a song about Oak
Hall that is about the finest thing I ever heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to be if it mentions us,&rdquo; answered
Dave, with a boldness that took away much of the
conceit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you haven&rsquo;t let me tell that story!&rdquo; interrupted
Shadow, with a disconcerted look on his
thin face. &ldquo;Now, as I was saying, there was
once a&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Not now, Shadow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tell it on the way to New York!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided the conductor will give you written
permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; returned the would-be story-teller.
&ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t tell that story now, I&rsquo;m going
to be mum forever.&rdquo; He suddenly looked at
Dave. &ldquo;What is taking you to New York?&rdquo; he
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way to Texas,&rdquo; answered Dave,
and then told his former classmates of how he and
Roger had passed the preliminary examination as
civil engineers and of how they were now going
to take up field work in the Lone Star State.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s great!&rdquo; exclaimed Buster, in admiration.
&ldquo;I wish I was going to do something
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; added Luke, while Shadow nodded
in assent.</p>
<p>The other lads had many questions to ask, and
in return told Dave much about themselves. In
the midst of the conversation the express train for
the metropolis rolled in and the four youths lost
no time in clambering aboard. They found their
seats with ease, and quickly settled themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fierce loss that the Basswoods sustained,&rdquo;
remarked Luke. &ldquo;I read all about it in
the newspapers. That fellow, Ward Porton,
must be a peach.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say he was a lemon so far as Dave
was concerned,&rdquo; said Buster, with a slow wink of
his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of peaches puts me in mind of another
story,&rdquo; cried Shadow. &ldquo;A man had a tree
in his garden and&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Shadow, why this infliction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have we really got to listen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much will you pay us if we keep still
until you have finished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ve got to listen, and I won&rsquo;t pay you
a cent for it, either,&rdquo; retorted the would-be story-teller.
&ldquo;This is a short one. A man had a
fruit-tree in his garden, and he told a friend of
his that he got three kinds of fruit from it. His
friend didn&rsquo;t believe it, so he told his friend:
&lsquo;Why, it was dead easy. I went out in the garden
to pick an apple. I picked one, and then I
picked a pair. One was no good, but another was
a peach.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! listen to that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shadow must have had a peach of a time getting
up that story,&rdquo; commented Luke, evidently
feeling himself justified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good thing there are not a pair of them,&rdquo;
came from Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such stories are the fruits of idleness,&rdquo; was
added by Buster, solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t you poke fun at that joke,&rdquo; retorted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
Shadow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal better than any
you could get up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave learned that Luke Watson&rsquo;s folks were
now living in New York City, and that Luke had
invited Buster and Shadow to spend a week with
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad you can&rsquo;t stop off, at least for a
day or two,&rdquo; said Luke to Dave. &ldquo;It would suit
me down to the ground to have you join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d like first-rate to do it, Luke,&rdquo; answered
our hero. &ldquo;But I promised to be in
Washington by to-morrow, and that means that
I&rsquo;ve got to take the midnight train from New
York City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll get down to New York by three
o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. That will give us nine
hours in which to have a good time. You&rsquo;ve got
to come up to our house for dinner,&rdquo; continued
Luke; and so it was arranged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering what I would do with myself
this evening,&rdquo; said our hero. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind
going around the city in the daylight, but after it
is dark it is rather hard for a stranger to put in
his time, unless he wants to go to some kind of
show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might all go to a moving-picture show
after dinner,&rdquo; suggested Buster. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll blow you
to front seats,&rdquo; he added generously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to make it a seat farther back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
than that for me,&rdquo; put in Shadow. &ldquo;A front
seat at a moving-picture show is no good,&rdquo; and
at this there was a general snicker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about the show after we have had
dinner,&rdquo; said Luke.</p>
<p>The time on the train was spent in talk about
Oak Hall and their numerous classmates, many of
them now well scattered throughout the States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly Vane has gone into business, so I hear,&rdquo;
announced Luke. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in real estate, and in
spite of the fact that he&rsquo;s a regular dude they tell
me he is doing very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Polly ought to do well,&rdquo; answered
Dave, who had not forgotten that the student who
acted so very girlishly had at graduation stood as
high in his percentage as our hero himself had
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they say Chip Macklin is doing pretty
well, too,&rdquo; put in Buster, referring to a small lad
who had once been a toady to Gus Plum, the Hall
bully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Plum is doing well,&rdquo; returned Dave.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he reformed. Evidently there was
much better stuff in him than there was in Jasniff
and Merwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jasniff and Merwell were thoroughly bad
eggs,&rdquo; announced Luke. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget,
Dave, how Jasniff once tried to brain you with an
Indian club.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, speaking about bad eggs, puts me in mind
of another story,&rdquo; cried Shadow. &ldquo;A lady went
into a store and asked the store-keeper&rsquo;s clerk
how much the eggs were. The clerk&ndash;&ndash;Now
don&rsquo;t interrupt me, because this isn&rsquo;t a very long
story,&rdquo; pleaded the would-be story teller. &ldquo;The
clerk was only a small boy, and he hadn&rsquo;t been in
the business very long, so he told the lady, &lsquo;The
really fresh eggs are fifty cents, and the almost
fresh eggs are forty cents, and those that ain&rsquo;t
so fresh are thirty-five cents, and the rotten eggs
are thirty cents.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Shadow! what a story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got any fresher than that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make anybody believe any such
yarn as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That story is absolutely true,&rdquo; returned the
story teller, soberly. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe it,
you come down to the town of Necopopec, Maine,
and on the principal street of the town I&rsquo;ll show
you the town pump where that boy used to get a
drink three times a day,&rdquo; and at this sally there
was a general laugh.</p>
<p>At last the train rolled into the Grand Central
Terminal at Forty-Second Street, New York City,
and, alighting, the lads made their way through
the spacious depot to the crowded thoroughfare
beyond. Here taxicabs were numerous, and the
youths piled into one, leaving the driver to look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
after their suit-cases. Dave&rsquo;s trunk had been
checked through to Washington.</p>
<p>Luke&rsquo;s family lived in the vicinity of Central
Park, and it did not take the chums long to reach
the home. Here they were greeted by Mrs. Watson,
Luke&rsquo;s father being away on business. Then
Luke took the lads up to his own room, where all
proceeded to make themselves at home.</p>
<p>At a little after five Mr. Watson came in to
greet them, and about an hour later all sat down
to a sumptuous dinner, to which it is needless to
say each of the boys applied himself diligently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see by the papers that they are showing a
very fine war spectacle at one of the photo-play
houses,&rdquo; announced Luke. &ldquo;How would you
fellows like to go and see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was agreeable to all, and a little later the
chums left the Watson house to go to the theater,
which was about ten blocks farther downtown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we get there by half-past seven, we can
take in the first show of the evening,&rdquo; announced
Luke. &ldquo;That will give us a chance to do some
other things before it is time for Dave to catch
his train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The war spectacle proved very entertaining to
all the youths, and they were rather sorry when
it came to an end. Then Buster proposed that
they walk down the Great White Way, as a certain
portion of Broadway has been designated.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></div>
<p>The boys had been walking for the best part of
half an hour, taking in various sights, including
the wonderfully illuminated signs, when suddenly,
as they passed through a rather dense crowd,
Shadow plucked Dave by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; questioned our hero, quickly,
for he saw that the former story-teller of Oak
Hall was much excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow we just passed, Dave!&rdquo; cried
Shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he looked just like you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo; gasped Dave, and came
to a sudden halt. &ldquo;If he looked like me it must
have been Ward Porton!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>DAVE IN WASHINGTON</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ward Porton!&rdquo; exclaimed the other
youths in a chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go after him,&rdquo; went on Dave.
&ldquo;Shadow, which way did he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; answered the story-teller,
and led the way through the crowd as well
as he could.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the crowd at this particular
spot on the Great White Way was dense,
and the chums had all they could do to force their
way along, often elbowing people in a way that
was far from polite. Presently they gained a
street corner where the pedestrians were being
held up by the traffic flowing the other way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; exclaimed Shadow, suddenly,
pointing with his hand.</p>
<p>Looking in the direction indicated, Dave saw
a well-known form. It was indeed Ward Porton,
still wearing the cap and overcoat he had stolen
from our hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi there, Porton! Stop!&rdquo; cried Dave, and
made a dash for the rascal.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<p>As his hand fell on Porton&rsquo;s arm the other
swung around in a startled way. Then, as he
caught sight of Dave and his friends, he gave a
sudden duck and crowded in between several ladies
standing in front of him. The next instant he
was dashing out into the street in the midst of a
perfect maze of automobiles and wagons.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after him!&rdquo; cried Dave to his
chums, and did his best to follow. But an automobile
got in his way, and then a large express
wagon, and before our hero could get around
these, Porton had gained the opposite sidewalk
and was darting through the crowd with great
rapidity, paying scant attention to those he met
and hurling one little girl off her feet and into
the gutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! What&rsquo;s the matter here?&rdquo; cried a
voice to Dave; and the next moment a policeman
came up beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow ahead! I want to catch him!&rdquo;
burst out our hero. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a thief!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he goes, straight into the crowd!&rdquo; answered
Dave, and then hurried on once more,
with his chums trailing behind him.</p>
<p>The chase so suddenly taken up did not, however,
prove long. By the time Dave and his
friends reached the next corner of the crowded
thoroughfare Ward Porton had disappeared once
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
more and none of the youths could tell what direction
he had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to do, Dave,&rdquo;
said Luke, sympathetically. &ldquo;He may have gone
ahead and then again he may have turned to the
right or to the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;ll be able to locate him in
such a crowd as this,&rdquo; put in Buster. &ldquo;What a
shame that you weren&rsquo;t able to get your hands on
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did have one hand on him, but he slipped
away like a greased pig,&rdquo; announced Dave, dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, speaking about greased pigs puts me in
mind of a story,&rdquo; put in Shadow. &ldquo;Once there
were two boys&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; and then, as his chums gave
him a sudden cold look, he continued: &ldquo;Oh,
pshaw! what&rsquo;s the use of trying to tell a story just
now. I know Dave would rather find this fellow
Porton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, Shadow!&rdquo; answered our
hero, quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather get my hands on him
than listen to a thousand stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave was unwilling to let the chase end there;
so he and his friends spent the remainder of the
evening walking up and down Broadway, and
traversing several blocks of the side streets in
the vicinity where Ward Porton had disappeared.
But it was all of no avail. The rascal had made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
good his escape. Then all walked around to the
nearest police station, and told the authorities of
the affair, so that the detectives of the city might
be on the watch for the criminal.</p>
<p>His chums insisted upon seeing Dave off on his
journey to Washington, and before going to the
Pennsylvania Railroad Station on Seventh Avenue
the youths treated themselves to a lunch. During
the meal Shadow was allowed to tell several
of his best stories, and Luke was called on to hum
over the song he had composed in honor of their
days at Oak Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine song, Luke, and you ought to
have it published,&rdquo; declared Dave, heartily. &ldquo;I
believe every lad who ever went to Oak Hall
would want a copy of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be mentioned here that later on Luke
Watson did have the composition brought out by
a metropolitan music publisher. He dedicated it
to the senior class of which he had been a member,
and the song sold very well.</p>
<p>Dave had already secured his berth on the train,
so that when his friends left him he lost no time
in retiring. But the novelty of the journey, and
his thoughts concerning Ward Porton, kept him
awake for some time. Finally, however, he went
sound asleep and did not awaken until some time
after the Capitol City was reached.</p>
<p>Senator Morr and his family were staying at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
the New Willard Hotel in Washington, and Dave
soon found a street car that passed the door of
that place. When he entered the hotel, he found
Roger in the lobby waiting for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d come right up,&rdquo; cried the
senator&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;I told the folks I&rsquo;d meet you.
Of course, you haven&rsquo;t had any breakfast? The
folks will be down in a little while and then we&rsquo;ll
all go to breakfast together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger was much interested to learn that Dave
had met three of their old chums, and wanted to
know all that had been said and done. The fact
that our hero had also seen Ward Porton was a
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a shame you didn&rsquo;t capture him, Dave!
Maybe you might have got on the track of that
Basswood fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I was thinking, Roger. I did my
best, but you know what a New York crowd is.
Porton slipped through it and disappeared almost
like magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senator Morr and his wife greeted Dave
warmly. The four had breakfast in a private
dining-room, and during the course of the meal the
senator had much to say regarding the departure
of his son and Dave for Texas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know one or two of the men connected with
the Mentor Construction Company,&rdquo; said the
senator. &ldquo;They are very fine fellows, and I think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
they will see to it that you are treated rightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad, of course, has some influence with
them,&rdquo; broke in Roger, &ldquo;being a senator, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use my influence that way, Roger,&rdquo;
answered the father, shortly. &ldquo;You must not expect
special favors because I happen to be a
United States senator. I expect you to make your
way on your own merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do,&rdquo; answered
the son, promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope both of you boys keep out of trouble,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Morr. &ldquo;You are going close to
the border of Mexico, and there has been fighting
going on along that border for many months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not going down there to get into any
fights,&rdquo; answered Dave. &ldquo;We are going down
there to attend strictly to business. If the Mexicans
will only leave us alone, we&rsquo;ll leave them
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave and Roger had at first thought to go to
Texas by the way of New Orleans and Houston,
but after some thought they decided to take the
journey by the way of St. Louis, Kansas City and
San Antonio. Their train was to leave on the
following morning, so that the two youths had a
whole day practically to themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am in Washington I&rsquo;d like to take a
look around,&rdquo; said Dave.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you&rsquo;d like to do that, so I got everything
ready beforehand,&rdquo; announced his chum.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll spend to-day in sightseeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They visited the Capitol and the White House,
and numerous other buildings, and almost before
they were aware it was evening. Then Mrs.
Morr insisted upon it that her son retire early,
knowing what a hard journey was before him.</p>
<p>The senator&rsquo;s son had received word that the
Mentor Construction Company had opened a temporary
office at San Antonio, and the two youths
were to report there before proceeding farther.
The engineering corps to which they had been
assigned was on the point of moving from one
place to another, and they were to get definite instructions
at San Antonio regarding their further
movements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye and good luck to you!&rdquo; said
the senator, who came down to the depot with
them to see them off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Dad,&rdquo; answered Roger, shaking
hands warmly. Dave, too, shook hands with his
chum&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Then, in a moment more, the two youths were
off on their long journey to Texas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of traveling is rather different from
what the pioneers put up with,&rdquo; remarked Roger,
as the two settled themselves in their comfortable
seats, they having a whole section of the sleeper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
to themselves. &ldquo;Think of what it must have been
to travel thousands of miles in a boomer wagon
behind a team of mules or oxen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Roger, and think of being on the lookout
constantly for unfriendly Indians and wild
beasts,&rdquo; added Dave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, when you
come to consider the luxuries we enjoy these days
we have much to be thankful for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day&rsquo;s run was a pleasant one, and the
youths enjoyed it greatly. They spent the time in
chatting about the prospects and in gazing at the
swiftly-moving panorama to be seen from the car
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity we have to sleep when there is so
much to see,&rdquo; was Dave&rsquo;s comment, as, after having
passed through Cincinnati, it grew time to retire.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like very much to see what this section
of the country looks like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following morning found them crossing
the Mississippi River. They passed through St.
Louis, and then the train headed for Kansas City,
where they were to change for Fort Worth and
San Antonio.</p>
<p>The train for San Antonio proved to be much
less crowded than the other had been. As before,
the youths had a section to themselves, and none
of the sections near them was occupied. But
when, on the following day, the train stopped at a
way station several passengers got aboard, including
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
a man who took the section opposite to that
occupied by our friends.</p>
<p>This man was a tall, heavy-set and red-faced individual,
having reddish hair and a heavy reddish
mustache. He looked the youths over rather
coldly, and then, throwing himself down in his
seat, proceeded to read a newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look like a very friendly fellow,&rdquo;
whispered Roger to Dave. &ldquo;I was hoping we
might meet somebody who would warm up a little
and tell us something about this part of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to go slow in making friends out
in a strange place like this,&rdquo; answered Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know about that, Dave,&rdquo; was the
quick reply. &ldquo;My father tells me that folks in
the West and Southwest are usually very friendly.
We found them so on our way to Star Ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys continued to talk of the prospects
ahead, and during the conversation the Mentor
Construction Company was mentioned several
times. Then Dave noticed that the burly man
opposite had dropped his newspaper and was looking
at them curiously. Finally the man arose and
stepped across the aisle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I hear you young fellows speaking about
the Mentor Construction Company?&rdquo; he asked,
not unpleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; answered Dave.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you connected with that concern?&rdquo; went
on the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to work for them,&rdquo; answered
Roger. &ldquo;We have just been appointed to the
engineering department.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say!&rdquo; cried the man in surprise.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with that company myself. My name is
William Jarvey. What is yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys told him, and all shook hands. Then,
as Roger crossed over to sit down beside Dave,
the man sank down in the seat opposite.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>IN TEXAS AT LAST</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you are going to join our engineering department,
eh?&rdquo; queried William Jarvey. &ldquo;Do
you know anybody in that department?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know any one down here,&rdquo; answered
Dave. &ldquo;We are utter strangers. We
obtained our positions through a Mr. Ramsdell,
who was our tutor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see.&rdquo; The man had been looking
rather sharply at Dave. &ldquo;May I ask where you
come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come from New England. I live in a
town called Crumville. My friend here is the
son of United States Senator Morr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed!&rdquo; William Jarvey showed increased
interest. &ldquo;The son of a United States
senator, eh? Well, that ought to help you a
great deal. The Mentor Construction Company
often has to ask the government for favors, you
know,&rdquo; and he laughed lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to trade on the fact that my
father is a United States senator,&rdquo; remarked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
Roger, somewhat shortly. &ldquo;I am going to make
my own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I guess you will. You look like a pretty
bright young man,&rdquo; returned William Jarvey,
hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a civil engineer?&rdquo; questioned Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! No such luck for me. I am connected
with the bookkeeping and the blue-print
department. I wish I were a first-class civil
engineer. I might be earning a much larger
salary;&rdquo; and the man drew down his mouth as he
spoke. Evidently he was a fellow who was not at
all satisfied with his position in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are to report to a Mr. Perry Watson at
San Antonio,&rdquo; explained Roger. &ldquo;He is to tell
us where to go and what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perry Watson, eh?&rdquo; and the man scowled
and showed his teeth in an unpleasant manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t you like Mr. Watson?&rdquo;
asked Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. Very few of the men do. He&rsquo;s
terribly sharp on watching everything a man
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope we don&rsquo;t have any trouble
with him,&rdquo; was Roger&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to
start right, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to watch yourselves pretty
closely,&rdquo; announced William Jarvey.</p>
<p>The talk then became general, and the burly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
man told the youths much about the work being
done by the Mentor Construction Company. It
seemed that there were four gangs in the field, two
operating south of San Antonio, and the others
to the westward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than likely you&rsquo;ll be sent to the
west,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think the gangs in the south
have all the helpers they need. I am going west
myself; so if you are sent that way perhaps we&rsquo;ll
see more of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; answered Dave. He was not particularly
elated over the thought, for there was
something about William Jarvey which did not
appeal to him. The man was evidently very overbearing
and had an exceedingly good opinion of
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going back to have a smoke,&rdquo; said the
man, presently. &ldquo;Will you come and join me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, but neither of us smokes,&rdquo; answered
Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! not even cigarettes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I don&rsquo;t see how you can resist. I
would feel utterly lost without a cigar. Well,
I&rsquo;ll see you later.&rdquo; And thus speaking <a name='TC_3'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'Wiliam'">William</ins>
Jarvey took himself off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely trust the rest of the men we meet
will be of a better sort than that fellow,&rdquo; remarked
Roger. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like his make-up at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Roger,&rdquo; answered Dave.
&ldquo;He looks like a chap who would be very dictatorial
if he had the chance&ndash;&ndash;one of the kind who
loves to ride over those under him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get over the way he kept looking at
you, Dave. He acted as if he had met you before
and was trying to place you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed he did look at me pretty closely a
number of times,&rdquo; answered our hero. &ldquo;But I
took it that he was only trying to size me up.
You know some strangers have that habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he didn&rsquo;t look at me that way,&rdquo; continued
the senator&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;I believe he was doing
his best to try to place you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had asked him where he was from.
Maybe that might have given us some sort of
clue to his identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask him if we get the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the journey to San Antonio they had an opportunity
to speak to William Jarvey a number of
times, and once they sat at the same table with
him in the dining-car. When asked where he
came from, he replied rather evasively that he
had lived for a great number of years in the
Northwest, but that he had left that section of the
country to try his fortunes in Mexico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was interested in the mines down there, and
then I got mixed up in one of their revolutions and
got shot in the leg,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;That was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
enough for me; so I crossed the Rio Grande into
Texas, and by luck got the position I am now holding
with the Mentor Company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the Mexican revolutionists interfering at
all with the work of the construction company
near the border?&rdquo; questioned Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much. One gang, that was working
on one of the railroad bridges not many miles
from the Rio Grande, had a little run-in with some
raiders who came across the river to steal cattle.
They helped the ranchmen drive the raiders away,
and in the fight one fellow was shot through the
shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that was trouble enough!&rdquo; cried Roger.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s more than I&rsquo;d like to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; returned Dave. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
come down to fight the Mexicans. We came
down to become civil engineers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll run into any fighting,&rdquo;
answered William Jarvey. &ldquo;But, of course, a
good many of those greasers are very treacherous
and there is no telling what they will do. They
shoot down and rob anybody they meet in their
own country, and then, when there is nothing in
sight on that side of the river, they watch their
chance and come over on this side. Of course,
United States soldiers are on the lookout for
them; so they don&rsquo;t dare to make their raids very
public.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></div>
<p>It developed that William Jarvey had been sent
up to Denison on business for the construction
company. He carried with him a heavy valise,
and also a large roll of blue-prints.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have been back to San Antonio yesterday,&rdquo;
he exclaimed. &ldquo;But I was delayed in
Denison. I suppose Perry Watson will be as mad
as a hornet when I get back because I didn&rsquo;t make
it as quick as he expected. He expects an awful
lot from those working under him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this neither of the youths replied. They
had noticed that William Jarvey smoked a great
deal and that his breath smelled strongly of liquor,
and they concluded that he was not a man who
would be likely to kill himself with overwork.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what Jarvey has told us of Mr. Watson
I am inclined to think the superintendent is a
hustling sort of fellow,&rdquo; remarked Dave, when
he and Roger were left alone. &ldquo;And, being that
kind of man, he probably can&rsquo;t stand for a fellow
who wants to loaf around and drink and smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ve sized it up about right, Dave,&rdquo;
answered the senator&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;In these days the
watchword seems to be &lsquo;keep moving&rsquo;; and a fellow
has got to &lsquo;get there&rsquo; if he wants to hold
down his job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last the train rolled into the city of San
Antonio. Before this place was reached William
Jarvey had met a number of other men who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
boarded the train at a station some miles away;
and he was so interested in what the newcomers
had to tell him that he seemed to forget completely
the presence of Dave and Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d just as lief he would forget us,&rdquo; said
our hero to his chum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather go to Mr.
Watson alone than have that man introduce us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly the way I feel about it,&rdquo; returned
the senator&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s see if we
can&rsquo;t slip away from him through the crowd.&rdquo;
This they did easily, and soon found themselves
walking along one of the quaint streets of San
Antonio bound for the building in which the Mentor
Construction Company had its temporary offices.</p>
<p>Contrary to what William Jarvey had told
them, they found Mr. Perry Watson a very pleasant
man with whom to deal. There was little of
nonsense about him, and he lost no time in finding
out who the youths were and for what they
had come. But his manner was courteous, and
he made both Dave and Roger feel thoroughly at
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Mr. Ramsdell very well. He&rsquo;s a fine
fellow,&rdquo; said the superintendent of the construction
company. &ldquo;I had a personal letter from
him in regard to you, and I&rsquo;m going to put you
out under one of the best men we have down here
in Texas, Mr. Ralph Obray, who is now working
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
on the construction of the new Catalco bridge to
the west of this place. He is expecting some new
helpers, and he asked me to send him the two best
fellows I could find, so I am going to send you,&rdquo;
and Mr. Watson smiled slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, Mr. Watson,&rdquo; answered
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t have to thank me, Porter,&rdquo; returned
the superintendent, quickly. &ldquo;You just
go out and make good. That is all this company
asks of any one it employs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you want us to start, Mr. Watson?&rdquo;
questioned Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can suit yourselves about that, although
the sooner you report to Mr. Obray the better I
think he&rsquo;ll be pleased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superintendent walked to a back door of
his office and called to some one without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll turn you over to one of our clerks and he
will give you all the details regarding your positions,&rdquo;
he explained.</p>
<p>The clerk proved to be a young man only a few
years older than Dave and Roger, and the youths
took to him at once. He explained in detail
where they were to go and what the construction
camp located near the new Catalco bridge consisted
of, and also told them what their work
would probably be for the first few months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;ve got to start at the bottom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
of the ladder,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll find
Mr. Obray a splendid man to be under, and you&rsquo;ll
probably learn more under him than you would
under any of our other head engineers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I&rsquo;m mighty glad Mr. Watson assigned
us to Mr. Obray&rsquo;s gang,&rdquo; answered Dave.</p>
<p>It was arranged that Dave and his chum should
start westward early the following morning.
This would give them a part of an afternoon and
an evening in San Antonio in which to look around
and take in the sights of that quaint town.</p>
<p>During the conversation with Mr. Watson and
the clerk, Dave had been rather surprised because
William Jarvey had not shown himself, because on
the train he had said he was behindhand; and they
had naturally supposed he would come to the offices
without delay. Just as they were preparing
to leave they heard an angry discussion going on
in Mr. Watson&rsquo;s private office, and they heard
the voices of the superintendent and the man they
had met on the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave you strict orders to come right back,
Jarvey,&rdquo; they heard Mr. Watson say. &ldquo;You
knew we were waiting for those blue-prints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was delayed,&rdquo; growled William Jarvey in
return. &ldquo;You see, there were some things about
the prints&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any excuses,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Watson.
&ldquo;The blue-prints were all right and were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
waiting for you. You took a day off simply to go
and have a good time. Now I want to warn you
for the last time. If such a thing happens again
I&rsquo;ll discharge you.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>AT THE ENGINEERING CAMP</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand now why that man Jarvey
spoke against Mr. Watson,&rdquo; remarked Dave, as
he and his chum walked along the main street of
San Antonio. &ldquo;Mr. Watson evidently has no use
for a fellow who doesn&rsquo;t attend to business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s all right, Dave,&rdquo; returned Roger.
&ldquo;Of course, he&rsquo;s business clean through. But that
is what you&rsquo;ve got to expect from a man who holds
such a position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Roger. The fellow who takes his
own time and does things about as he pleases has
no place in the modern business world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two youths had received full instructions
regarding what they were to do. They were to
take a train westward early in the morning for a
small place known as Molona, situated but a short
distance from the Rio Grande. There they were
to report to Mr. Ralph Obray. Mr. Watson had
asked them regarding what they had brought along
in the way of baggage, and on being questioned
had advised them to purchase several other things
before starting for the engineering camp.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly an odd sort of place&ndash;&ndash;quite
different from a New England town,&rdquo; was Dave&rsquo;s
comment, as he and his chum went from one shop
to another in San Antonio in quest of the things
they wished to buy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me that it has quite a Mexican flavor
to it,&rdquo; remarked Roger. &ldquo;Just see all the big
hats and the fringed trousers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that they had come so far the chums were
eager to get to the camp, and they could scarcely
wait until the following morning. They found a
comfortable hotel, had an early breakfast, and by
seven o&rsquo;clock were on their way westward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we are almost on the border,&rdquo; remarked
Roger, as they stopped at a place called Del Rio.
He was studying a railroad map. &ldquo;At the next
place, called Viaduct, we will be on the Rio
Grande, with Mexico just across from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t such a very grand river after all,&rdquo; remarked
Dave, when they came in sight of the
stream. &ldquo;It looks more like a great big overgrown
creek to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t compare these rivers with the Hudson
or the St. Lawrence, Dave. But I suppose
at certain seasons of the year this river gets to be
pretty big.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon their train rolled into Molona and the
youths alighted. The station was a primitive affair,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
consisting of a small platform and a building
not over ten feet square.</p>
<p>Word had been sent ahead that they were coming,
and among the several Texans and Mexicans
who had gathered to watch the train come in,
they found a middle-aged man on a burro with two
other burros standing behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the young fellows for the Mentor
camp?&rdquo; he questioned, as Dave and Roger approached
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; returned our hero, quickly. &ldquo;Did
you come for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did. Mr. Watson sent a wire that you were
coming, so the boss sent me here to get you, thinking
you wouldn&rsquo;t know the way. Porter and
Morr, I believe&ndash;&ndash;but which is which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Dave Porter,&rdquo; answered Dave, &ldquo;and
this is my chum, Roger Morr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to know you. My name is Frank Andrews.
I am from Scranton, Pennsylvania. I
suppose you can ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; answered Roger. &ldquo;We did more
or less riding when we were out on Star Ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough! Some of the young fellows
who come out here can&rsquo;t ride at all, and they have
some trouble getting around, believe me! This,
you know, is the country of magnificent distances,&rdquo;
and Frank Andrews laughed.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How many have you in the camp here?&rdquo;
questioned Dave, after he and Roger had mounted
the two waiting burros and were riding off beside
the man from the engineering camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are twenty of us in the engineering
gang, and I think they have about seventy to
eighty men in the construction camp, with forty
or fifty more on the way. You see, they have been
bothered a great deal for hired help lately on account
of the trouble with the Mexican bandits and
revolutionists. Lots of men are afraid to come
down here to work for fear some bandits will
make a raid across the border and shoot them
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you had any trouble lately?&rdquo; questioned
Roger, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had trouble about two weeks ago. A
couple of dirty Mexicans came into camp and were
caught trying to steal away that night with some
of our belongings. One of the fellows got a
crack on the head with a club, and the other we
think was shot in the side. But both of them
got away in the darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s interesting, to say the least,&rdquo; remarked
Dave, drily. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve got to sleep with
our eyes open, as the saying is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve certainly got to watch yourself while
you&rsquo;re down here,&rdquo; answered Frank Andrews.
&ldquo;There is more <i>talk</i> about trouble than anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
else, but the talk gets on some of the men&rsquo;s nerves,
and we have had one civil engineer and two helpers
leave us just on that account. They said they
would prefer to work somewhere in the United
States where they wouldn&rsquo;t be worried thinking
the greasers might attack them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the party rode along they had to cross a
bridge which was comparatively new, and their
guide explained that this structure was one
erected by the Mentor Company. Then they
went over a slight rise, and finally came into view
of a long row of one-story buildings with several
rows of adobe houses behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are at the camp!&rdquo; announced the
guide. &ldquo;The engineering gang lives and does
business in these houses here, and those huts at
the back are used by the construction gangs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class='figtag'>

<p class='caption'>
<span class='smcap'>&ldquo;Here we are at the camp!&rdquo; announced the guide.</span>&ndash;&ndash;<i>Page 225.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>It was all so new and novel to Dave and Roger
that they were intensely interested. With their
guide they rode up to the main building and dismounted.
In a moment more they found themselves
inside and confronted by Mr. Ralph Obray,
the head of the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you,&rdquo; he said, shaking hands after
they had introduced themselves. &ldquo;We are rather
short of helpers just now; so you&rsquo;ll find plenty to
do. I understand Mr. Ramsdell has given you a
first-class recommendation. I hope that you&rsquo;ll be
able to live up to it,&rdquo; and he smiled faintly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to do what I can, Mr. Obray,&rdquo;
answered Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so am I,&rdquo; added Roger.</p>
<p>Frank Andrews had already told them that a
man with a wagon would be sent down to the station
for their trunks and suitcases, all of which
had been left in charge of the station-master.
The youths were taken to one of the buildings not
far from the office, and there assigned to a room
containing two cots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, this isn&rsquo;t the Biltmore Hotel or the
Waldorf Astoria,&rdquo; remarked Frank Andrews,
with a grin. &ldquo;If you stay out here you&rsquo;ll have
to learn to rough it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know something about roughing it already,&rdquo;
answered Dave. &ldquo;If the other fellows
can stand it I guess we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find it so bad when you get used to
it,&rdquo; answered the man. &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s pretty
hot during the day, but the nights are quite comfortable.
We&rsquo;ve got a first-class colored cook,
so you won&rsquo;t find yourselves cut short on meals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good news,&rdquo; answered the senator&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;I always thought that a good meal covered
a multitude of sins,&rdquo; and at this misquotation
Frank Andrews laughed heartily.</p>
<p>The man had already been despatched to get
the baggage, and after it arrived Dave and Roger
proceeded to make themselves at home, each donning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
such clothing as they saw the others of the
engineering corps wearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good-bye to boiled shirts and stiff collars,&rdquo;
said Roger, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not sorry for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor am I,&rdquo; returned Dave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll feel much
more like working in this comfortable outfit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost before they knew it, it was noon, and
presently they saw a number of men, some of them
quite young, coming in to dinner. Through
Frank Andrews they were introduced to all the
others, and then placed at one of the tables in the
mess hall where a helper of Jeff, the cook, served
them with a meal which, if not exactly elegant,
was certainly well-cooked and substantial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you two young men to stay around the
offices for the rest of this week,&rdquo; announced Mr.
Obray to them after the meal. &ldquo;That will give
you a chance to familiarize yourselves with what
we are doing in the way of constructions in this
vicinity. Then next week you can go out with the
gang and begin your regular field practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The youths soon found that practical work in
the office was quite different from the theoretical
work done under Mr. Ramsdell. Still their tutor
had instructed them faithfully, so that they soon
&ldquo;caught on,&rdquo; as Roger remarked.</p>
<p>When they did not understand a thing they did
not hesitate to ask questions, and they found the
other persons present very willing to explain and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
to help them. There was a spirit of comradeship
throughout the whole camp that was as comforting
as it was beneficial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t everybody for himself here,&rdquo; explained
Frank Andrews. &ldquo;It is one for all.
You are expected to do all you can for the other
fellow, and in return it&rsquo;s understood that he will
do all he can for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine method,&rdquo; answered Dave; &ldquo;and I
don&rsquo;t wonder that the Mentor Construction Company
is making such a success of its undertakings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day our hero asked Frank Andrews if he
knew William Jarvey. At the question the man
drew down the corners of his mouth and shook
his head in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know Bill,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s over
in the offices at San Antonio mostly, but he occasionally
comes out here on business for Mr. Watson.
I must say I don&rsquo;t like him very much, and
I don&rsquo;t think the other men do either. He&rsquo;s a
fellow who likes to drink now and then, and I
understand he often gambles. That is, when he
has the money. He&rsquo;s usually strapped long before
pay-day comes around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he might be that sort of fellow,&rdquo;
answered Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He got into a row with Mr. Watson while
we were at San Antonio,&rdquo; put in Roger, and related
a few of the particulars.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If Bill doesn&rsquo;t look out he&rsquo;ll lose his job, and
it will be too bad,&rdquo; answered Frank Andrews,
&ldquo;because he won&rsquo;t be likely to get another such
easy berth in a hurry. He gets good money for
what little he does. He hired with the company
as a first-class bookkeeper, but I understand he is
only ordinary when it comes to handling big
masses of figures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t like him when I met him, and
I&rsquo;d be just as well satisfied if we didn&rsquo;t meet
again,&rdquo; said Dave.</p>
<p>But Dave&rsquo;s wish was not to be gratified. He
was to meet William Jarvey in the future, and
that meeting was to bring with it a great surprise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>A MIDNIGHT ALARM</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dave, we have been in this camp just
a month to-day. How do you think you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it first-rate, Roger&ndash;&ndash;in fact, better
than I first thought I would. All the engineers
and assistants are so kind and helpful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they are,&rdquo; returned the senator&rsquo;s
son. &ldquo;And I think we are getting along
famously. Do you know, I am actually in love
with the construction of this new Catalco bridge.
I think it&rsquo;s going to be a dandy when it&rsquo;s completed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only a dandy, Roger, but, unless I miss
my guess, it will be a monument to the skill and
ingenuity of the Mentor Construction Company.
I&rsquo;ve been reading up on all kinds of bridges, and
I think the construction of this particular bridge
goes ahead of most of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing is sure&ndash;&ndash;Mr. Obray is very proud
of the way things are going. I heard from Andrews
that some of the other construction companies
thought we would never be able to build
this bridge the way it is going up.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>The talk between the two chums was held in
the evening after work for the day had come to
an end. Dave and Roger stood on an elevation
of ground surveying the unfinished bridge&ndash;&ndash;or
rather chain of bridges&ndash;&ndash;which spanned a river
and the marshland beyond. It had been a great
engineering feat to obtain the proper foundations
for the bridge where it spanned the marshland,
and make them impervious to the floods which
came with great force during certain seasons of
the year.</p>
<p>The first week at the camp had been spent in
the offices, but all the other time had been put in
with the engineering gang that was superintending
the construction of the far end of the bridge, and
also the laying out of the railroad route through
the hills and cuts beyond. The work had proved
fascinating to the chums, and they were surprised
to see how quickly the time passed.</p>
<p>Dave and Roger had made a number of friends,
but none more agreeable than Frank Andrews.
Andrews occupied a room close to their own, and
often spent an evening with them.</p>
<p>About the end of the second week they had received
word concerning William Jarvey. The
bookkeeper in the offices at San Antonio had had a
violent quarrel with Mr. Watson and had been
discharged. He had gone off declaring that his
being treated thus was unjustifiable, and that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
was going to bring the Mentor Construction Company
to account for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s nothing but a bag of wind,&rdquo; was
Roger&rsquo;s comment, on hearing this. &ldquo;The company
is probably much better off to have such a
chap among the missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what he can do to hurt the company,&rdquo;
had been Dave&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;He was probably
discharged for good cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although so far away from home, it must not
be supposed that Dave and Roger had forgotten
the folks left behind. They had sent numerous
letters telling of their various experiences and of
what they hoped to do in the future. In return
Roger had received one letter from his father and
another from his mother, and Dave had gotten
communications from his sister Laura and from
Jessie, and also a long letter from Ben.</p>
<p>Of these the letter received from Jessie was to
our hero the most important, and it must be confessed
that he read it a number of times. The girl
was greatly interested in all that he had told her
about his work, and she said she hoped he would
become a great civil engineer, and that she certainly
trusted he would not have any trouble with
the Mexicans.</p>
<p>The letter from Ben Basswood had been rather
a disheartening communication. Ben wrote that
his father did not seem to regain his health as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
rapidly as the doctor had anticipated, and that
nothing new concerning Ward Porton or Tim
Crapsey had been uncovered. Ben added that he
had written to the authorities in New York City
concerning Porton and had received word back
that they had been unable to locate the former
moving-picture actor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the loss of those miniatures has had
its full effect on Mr. Basswood,&rdquo; remarked Dave,
when speaking of the matter to his chum. &ldquo;I
suppose it makes him feel blue, and that retards
his recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely,&rdquo; answered Roger. &ldquo;A
person can&rsquo;t very well throw off a heavy spell of
sickness when he is so depressed in spirits. It&rsquo;s
too bad! And I suppose Mrs. Basswood feels
dreadful to think she was the one to let the fortune
slip out of their hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt of it, Roger. Of course, it&rsquo;s easy
enough to blame her, and I suppose a great many
of their neighbors do. But, just the same, place
yourself in her position&ndash;&ndash;worried half to death
over the sickness of her husband&ndash;&ndash;and you might
have done the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a warm evening and the chums took their
time in returning to the camp, knowing supper
would not be served until a little later. During
the day several shots had been heard at a great
distance to the southward, and some of the civil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
engineers had wondered if some sort of a scrimmage
was taking place on the other side of the Rio
Grande.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a fight is in progress I hope it doesn&rsquo;t extend
to this neighborhood,&rdquo; remarked one of the
engineers, in speaking of the matter. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got troubles enough of our own&ndash;&ndash;getting this
bridge right&ndash;&ndash;without having the greasers interfering
with our work;&rdquo; and he gave a grim
laugh.</p>
<p>When the chums arrived in camp they found
that the day&rsquo;s mail had come in. There was a
Washington newspaper for Roger containing an
address delivered in the Senate by Senator Morr,
and also a long letter for our hero from Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here is news at last!&rdquo; cried Dave, as
he scanned the communication. &ldquo;Come on out
here, away from the crowd, Roger, and I&rsquo;ll read
it to you;&rdquo; and then he led the way to a corner and
acquainted his chum with the contents of the letter,
which was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I know you will be interested to learn that we
have at last heard from that rascal, Tim Crapsey,
who, with Ward Porton, got the miniatures from
my mother. Crapsey sent a very badly written
letter to my father, stating that he and Porton
had parted company, but that he had the most of
the miniatures,&ndash;&ndash;in fact, all but six of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crapsey wrote that he was in the city of New
York, and had the miniatures in a safe place, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
that he would return them to us for fifteen thousand
dollars. We were to insert a personal advertisement
in one of the New York newspapers
if we were willing to accept his offer, and then he
would send us word how the exchange of money
for the miniatures could be made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, as you know, my father is still sick.
He didn&rsquo;t have anything like fifteen thousand dollars
in cash to offer Crapsey, and besides that Mr.
Wadsworth and your Uncle Dunston thought it
was altogether too much money to offer a thief
like that. In fact, your uncle was of the opinion
that they should only try to lead Crapsey on, so
that they could capture him. But my father,
backed up by Mr. Wadsworth, at length agreed to
put up five thousand dollars in order to get the
miniatures back, and an advertisement was inserted
in the newspapers to that effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We waited two days for a reply, and then
came a scrawl on a bit of paper signed by Crapsey,
stating that he was having trouble of another
kind and could not for the present keep on with
his negotiations. After that my father inserted
another advertisement asking for more information,
but up to the present time no additional word
has come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father does not know what to make of it.
Your folks and Mr. Wadsworth are of the opinion
that either Crapsey was trying to fool them and
got scared or else that the rascal has been caught
by the police for some other crime and is trying to
conceal his identity. They are divided on the
question as to whether to believe Crapsey when he
wrote that he and Porton had parted company&ndash;&ndash;they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
are half inclined to believe that Porton is still
with him, and that the whole scheme was framed
up by Porton.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That is certainly interesting news,&rdquo; remarked
Roger, after both had perused the letter a second
time. &ldquo;And it settles one thing&ndash;&ndash;and that is
that Tim Crapsey must have been in New York
with Ward Porton at the time we saw the latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Roger. And it also proves beyond a
doubt that that pair were really the thieves.
Previous to this we only supposed such to be the
fact&ndash;&ndash;we really couldn&rsquo;t prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was sure of it all along, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So was I, Roger. But you know in a court
of law it is one thing to know a thing and another
to be able to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two young civil engineers discussed the letter
all through the evening meal and even for
some time later. Then, however, Roger turned
to his newspaper, to read with care the address
that his father had delivered. Dave was also interested
in this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be in the Senate some time when
your father was speaking,&rdquo; he remarked to his
chum. &ldquo;It must be a great sight to see such a
body as that when it is in session.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Dave,&rdquo; answered his chum. &ldquo;And people
come thousands of miles to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before retiring for the night Dave penned a letter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
to Ben, and also sent a letter to Jessie, and another
to his Uncle Dunston which was meant for
the entire household. Roger spent the time in a
communication to his mother, and also in a long
letter to Luke Watson.</p>
<p>The night proved to be unusually warm, for
the breeze which was usually stirring had died
down completely. Dave fell into a fitful doze,
from which he awoke about midnight to find his
mouth and throat quite parched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;d better get up and get a drink,&rdquo; he
told himself, &ldquo;and then I may be able to sleep better.
Phew! but the thermometer has certainly
been going up the last few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arose to his feet and walked out of the room
into the hallway of the building, where in one
corner there was a water-cooler. He had just
finished drinking a glass of water when a sound
from outside reached his ears. There was a
shout from a distance, followed almost instantly
by a rifle shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! what can that mean?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>A moment later came more shouts, this time a
little closer to the camp. Then two more rifle
shots rang out sharply through the midnight air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something is wrong, that&rsquo;s sure!&rdquo; exclaimed
the youth. Rushing back into the bedroom he
shook Roger vigorously. At the same time he
heard others getting up and calling to each other,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
wanting to know what the shouts and shots meant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want, Dave?&rdquo; asked the senator&rsquo;s
son, sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up, Roger!&rdquo; answered our hero, quickly.
&ldquo;Hurry up! there is something going on outside!
I just heard a number of yells and several rifle
shots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean it, Dave!&rdquo; and now Roger
was on his feet with a bound. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s the
greasers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, Roger. But I guess
we had better slip into our clothing. Maybe
somebody is&ndash;&ndash; Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave broke off short, and both strained their
ears to hear what was taking place outside. They
heard a confused shouting, followed by several
yells. And then came a volley of shots&ndash;&ndash;five or
six in number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an attack! That&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo; cried the
senator&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet some of those Mexican
bandits are coming over here! Oh, Dave! what
do you suppose we had better do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, except that we had better slip
on our clothing and get our pistols,&rdquo; answered
Dave. &ldquo;This looks as if it might be serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up, boys! Up!&rdquo; came the cry from somebody
outside. &ldquo;Get your guns and your pistols!
The Mexican raiders are coming this way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the time the two chums had hastily donned
their clothing and possessed themselves of the
pistols they had purchased in San Antonio on the
advice of Mr. Watson, the camp was in confusion
from end to end, with the various bosses shouting
orders and the men themselves wanting to know
what the trouble was and what they had better do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some of those confounded greasers!&rdquo;
cried Frank Andrews, as he, too, arose and armed
himself. He had a repeating rifle, and it was
known to Dave and Roger that he was an exceptionally
good shot.</p>
<p>Andrews led the way from the building, followed
by our hero and Roger and several others.
In the meantime, the distant shouting and shooting
seemed to have moved farther westward, in
the direction where the new Catalco bridge was
being constructed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be their intention to blow up the
bridge?&rdquo; queried Roger. There had been talk
of this several times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No telling what those rascals are up to,&rdquo; answered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
Frank Andrews. &ldquo;This may be only a
rumpus kicked up to cover a cattle raid or something
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of the excitement the telephone in
the main office began to ring and was answered by
one of the clerks. A few minutes later he came
rushing out to where Mr. Obray stood talking to
his assistant and the boss of the construction camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just got a telephone from the Tolman ranch,&rdquo;
announced the clerk. &ldquo;Old man Tolman said
they had been raided and that half of the raiders
were coming this way. I tried to get some details
from him, but in the midst of the talk I was shut
off. I suppose somebody cut the wire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that might be it,&rdquo; answered the head
of the engineering corps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to help Tolman all we can,&rdquo; announced
the boss of the construction camp. &ldquo;He
promised to assist us in case we had any trouble,
and turn about is fair play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, Peterson, and any man who
wants to go out can do it.&rdquo; And word was passed
around to this effect.</p>
<p>Dave and Roger listened to this talk and what
followed with much interest. In less than five
minutes over thirty men from the construction
camp had signified their willingness to go after
the raiders, and these men were joined by Frank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
Andrews and three other civil engineers, all well
armed and mounted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to join that crowd and go after those
Mexicans!&rdquo; exclaimed Dave, his eyes sparkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I!&rdquo; returned the senator&rsquo;s son,
quickly. &ldquo;Those fellows can&rsquo;t be anything but
plain bandits and cattle thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! No regular revolutionists would come
over the border and act in this fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say, Dave&ndash;&ndash;shall we go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! You young fellows had better stay
in the camp,&rdquo; announced Ralph Obray, who overheard
the talk. &ldquo;Just remember that in a certain
sense I am responsible for your safety while
you are under me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those others are going,&rdquo; returned Dave,
somewhat reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they are, Porter. But they are all older
than you, and most of them have had experience
in this sort of thing. I would rather that you
stayed here. Maybe if those raiders come this
way we&rsquo;ll have our hands full defending the
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave and Roger realized that for the head of
the camp to express his desire in this instance was
equal practically to a command; so they at once
gave up the idea of following Frank Andrews and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
the others. The men rode off quickly, and were
soon lost to sight in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>An hour of intense anxiety passed. During
that time those left in the camp heard an occasional
shot in the distance. Then several shots
seemed much closer. There followed some yelling,
and, then about five minutes later, came a
dull explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s at the bridge!&rdquo; exclaimed Dave.
&ldquo;They must be trying to blow it up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dull explosion was followed by a sudden
rattle of rifle and pistol shots and more yelling.
Once or twice some men seemed to come quite
near to the construction camp, the hoof strokes
of the horses being distinctly heard.</p>
<p>All who remained in the camp were on the lookout,
and each man stood ready with his weapon to
do what he could to defend the place should the
occasion arise. But with the explosion and the
rattle of rifle and pistol shots that followed, the
conflict seemed to die down, and presently all became
utter silence; and thus two more hours
passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever they were, they seem to have left
this vicinity entirely,&rdquo; said Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish it was morning,&rdquo; put in another of the
young men present. The watching was beginning
to get on his nerves.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>At last, just as the first streaks of dawn were beginning
to show in the eastern sky, a number of
horsemen were descried approaching from the
southward. All in the camp were instantly on
their guard, but it was soon seen that it was their
friends who were coming back. They came in
somewhat of a horseshoe formation, driving in
their midst four prisoners, one of them with his
arm done up in a sling and another with his head
bandaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got somebody!&rdquo; exclaimed Roger, as
the crowd came closer, &ldquo;Four greasers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of them look like Mexicans, but the
other fellow looks like an American,&rdquo; returned
Dave, as the party came to a halt in front of the
camp buildings.</p>
<p>Those who had come in were at once surrounded
by the others, who wanted to know the particulars
of what had taken place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a band of about thirty greasers, and
with them were two or three Americans,&rdquo; announced
Frank Andrews. &ldquo;They went down to
old man Tolman&rsquo;s corral and tried to drive off
about two hundred head of cattle. They got
away from the ranch, and then part of the gang
came over this way in the vicinity of the new
bridge. We had two running fights with them,
and then they let the cattle go and started for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Rio Grande. But before they went one of the
rascals set off a bomb near the end of the bridge
and blew up a corner of the foundation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why in the world did they want to blow up
the bridge?&rdquo; demanded Mr. Obray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t all Mexicans, Mr. Obray. Several
of them were Americans. We&rsquo;ve got one of
the Americans right here. And do you know who
it is? Jack Pankhurst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; exclaimed the head of the
camp, and then he turned to the prisoners. One
man had his sombrero pulled well down over his
forehead, as if somewhat ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; went on Frank Andrews, pointing
to this individual. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jack Pankhurst,
who was discharged for drinking and gambling
about two months ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Obray strode up to the prisoner and gave
him a tap under the chin, thus elevating his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine specimen of humanity, Pankhurst!&rdquo;
he cried sternly. &ldquo;A fine business for
you to be in&ndash;&ndash;joining Mexican outlaws and becoming
a cattle rustler. What have you to say
for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything to say,&rdquo; grumbled the
prisoner. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use? I was caught with
the goods, wasn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to think an American would go
in with a bunch of Mexican bandits,&rdquo; said Mr.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
Obray; and then gave directions that the prisoners
should be well bound so that there would be no
possibility of their escaping.</p>
<p>All listened with interest to the details of the
cattle raid so far as the men who had gone out
from the construction camp could relate. They
said that some of the fighting had been exceedingly
hot, and they were satisfied that a number of the
Mexicans, and also one of the Americans with
them, had been wounded.</p>
<p>They themselves had not escaped unscathed,
one man being hit in the shoulder and another in
the leg. Fortunately, however, neither of these
wounds proved serious. The camp doctor was
called in to attend them, after which he attended
the wounded prisoners. In the meantime, a message
was sent to the railroad station and to San
Antonio, to acquaint the authorities with what had
occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was questioning Pankhurst on the way
here,&rdquo; said Frank Andrews to the head of the
camp. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t admit it outright, but I am
strongly of the opinion that one of the other
Americans who was with him was Bill Jarvey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jarvey!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Obray. &ldquo;Well, it
would be just like him to join a fellow like Pankhurst.
They were quite chummy when they both
worked for the company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got another idea about this affair,&rdquo; went
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
on Andrews. &ldquo;Do you remember how they said
Jarvey vowed he would get square with the company
for discharging him? I&rsquo;ve got an idea that
it was his scheme to attempt to blow up the bridge,
and that he was the one who set off that bomb.
Their idea was to get the cattle to some safe place
first, and then ruin the bridge. More than likely
Jarvey and Pankhurst made a deal with the
greasers to that effect&ndash;&ndash;the Americans to help
with the cattle and the Mexicans to help destroy
our work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right, Andrews,&rdquo; answered Ralph
Obray. &ldquo;And if you are, it&rsquo;s a pity that you
didn&rsquo;t catch Jarvey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave and Roger listened to this talk with interest,
and also joined in the general discussion of
those in the camp regarding the raid, and what
would be done with the prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they will turn the prisoners over to
the United States authorities,&rdquo; was Dave&rsquo;s
opinion; and in this he was right. Some government
officers appeared by noon of the next day,
and after a lengthy talk with the head of the camp
and a number of others, the prisoners, including
Jack Pankhurst, were taken away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if old man Tolman got his cattle
back,&rdquo; remarked Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but three of the animals,&rdquo; answered one
of the men present. &ldquo;Those were trampled to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
death during the raid. But three are nothing
alongside of two hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The raid had caused so much excitement in the
camp that there was but little work done that day.
The boys went down with the others to inspect
the bridge, and look curiously at the hole which
had been torn in the corner of one of the foundations
by the bomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was certainly a mean piece of business,&rdquo;
was our hero&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t do anybody
a bit of good, and it&rsquo;s going to make a good deal
of work to repair the damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several days passed, and the camp at last settled
back into its usual routine. Dave and Roger
worked as hard as ever, and both were much
pleased when Mr. Obray told them that they were
doing very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to write a letter to Mr. Ramsdell,&rdquo;
said the head of the camp, &ldquo;and tell him
that I am well satisfied with his pupils,&rdquo; and he
smiled faintly.</p>
<p>A day or two later word came to the camp
which interested the chums as much as it did anybody.
It seemed that Jack Pankhurst had been
subjected to a &ldquo;third degree&rdquo; of questioning.
He had broken down completely and confessed
that the two other Americans in the raid with him
had been former employees of the Mentor Construction
Company&ndash;&ndash;one a fellow named Packard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
Brown, and the other William Jarvey.
Pankhurst had also let fall the information that
Jarvey had once been an officer in the United
States Army, and that he was traveling under an
assumed name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A former officer of our army and acting in
that way!&rdquo; exclaimed Dave, when he heard this
report. &ldquo;I certainly do hope they&rsquo;ll catch him
and punish him as he deserves!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sentiments exactly!&rdquo; added Roger.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE CHASE ON THE BRIDGE</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;My, Dave! but it&rsquo;s hot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, Roger. This is the hottest
day we&rsquo;ve struck yet. And such a hard day as
it&rsquo;s been too!&rdquo; and our hero paused to wipe the
perspiration from his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you say if we take a swim this evening?&rdquo;
went on the senator&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;A plunge
into the river would feel good to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, Roger. Let us eat a light
supper and get down to the river before it grows
too dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four weeks had passed since the events narrated
in the last chapter, and matters in and
around the construction camp had once more
quieted down. Work was being pushed forward
rapidly, and Dave and Roger were making excellent
progress in their chosen profession. They
had made a warm personal friend of Frank Andrews,
as well as a friend of Mr. Obray, and both
of these individuals gave them many instructions
during off hours which proved highly beneficial.</p>
<p>No more had been heard from the Mexican
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
raiders, and it was hoped that those bandits had
departed for some other locality along the Rio
Grande. The prisoners taken during the raid
were still in jail, awaiting trial.</p>
<p>Down along the stream over which the new
Catalco bridge was being constructed there was a
favorite swimming place used by the civil engineers
and their assistants, the men and boys of the
construction gang using another spot farther down
the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll beat you getting in, Dave!&rdquo; cried Roger,
as the pair neared the bathing place that evening,
and he started to take off some of his clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t jump in too quickly, Roger,&rdquo; warned
our hero. &ldquo;Remember you have just been eating
and you are rather warm. Better take it easy
on the bank for a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to get a cramp or a chill, or anything
like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To reach the swimming spot, the chums had to
pass one end of the new bridge. As they drew
closer they saw somebody high up on the skeleton
structure gazing at them curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! who&rsquo;s that up there?&rdquo; remarked
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Roger. &ldquo;I
thought all our men were back in camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they came still closer the individual on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
bridge turned to walk toward them. Suddenly,
however, he stopped short and tried his best to
hide himself behind some of the steel work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say! that looks rather queer to me,&rdquo; remarked
Dave. &ldquo;He acts just as if he didn&rsquo;t want
us to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what I thought, Dave.&rdquo; The senator&rsquo;s
son gave a sudden start. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;s
one of those Mexican raiders, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say anything about that. I&rsquo;m going
up there to find out who he is. It seems to me he
is acting very suspiciously. Maybe he&rsquo;s trying
to plant some more bombs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave turned back to a point where he could get
up on the bridge, and his chum followed. From
this point they could not see the person above them
nor could he see them. When they reached the
flooring of the big bridge they were less than two
hundred feet from where the unknown person
stood. He was leaning over the side of the structure,
evidently trying to find out what had become
of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dave, he&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;looks like you!&rdquo;
burst out the senator&rsquo;s son, as both hurried in the
direction of the unknown person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do believe it&rsquo;s Ward Porton!&rdquo; ejaculated
our hero. He began to quicken his pace. &ldquo;Yes,
I&rsquo;m almost sure it&rsquo;s Porton,&rdquo; he added, a few seconds
later.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s Porton what in the world tempted him
to follow you to this place?&rdquo; queried Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I do know that I&rsquo;m going
to capture him if it is possible to do so,&rdquo; answered
Dave, with determination.</p>
<p>The two chums were still almost a hundred feet
from the other person when the latter glanced up
suddenly and discovered them. He looked them
full in the face for just an instant, and then turned
and began to run away towards the opposite end
of the long bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Porton, sure enough!&rdquo; burst out
Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi there, Porton! Stop!&rdquo; cried Dave.
&ldquo;Stop, I tell you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on back!&rdquo; yelled Ward Porton, in
an ugly voice. &ldquo;Go on back, I tell you! If you
don&rsquo;t it will be the worse for you!&rdquo; and he shook
his fist at the chums.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might as well stop,&rdquo; continued Dave, undaunted
by the threat. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get away
from us. If you try to jump off the unfinished end
of the bridge you&rsquo;ll break your neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you fellows don&rsquo;t go back I&rsquo;ll shoot,&rdquo; returned
the fellow who resembled Dave. &ldquo;Stop
right where you are! Don&rsquo;t dare to come a step
closer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! do you suppose he is armed?&rdquo;
questioned Roger, hastily and in a low tone.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he is. But I am going to keep on
after him until he shows his pistol,&rdquo; was the rapid
reply. &ldquo;You need not come if you don&rsquo;t want
to. I&rsquo;m going to capture him and make him
give up the Basswood fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are going after him, so am I,&rdquo; returned
the senator&rsquo;s son, sturdily. &ldquo;Maybe it
was only a bluff about shooting after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While running along the bridge Dave&rsquo;s eyes
fell on a short steel bar left there by one of the
workmen. He stopped just long enough to pick
the bar up, and then went after Porton with all the
speed at his command.</p>
<p>It was a perilous chase, for in many places the
flooring of the big bridge was still missing and
they had to leap from girder to girder of the
steel structure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, I tell you!&rdquo; yelled Ward Porton once
more, when Dave was within ten yards of him.
And then he turned squarely around and our hero
and Roger saw the glint of a pistol as the rascal
pointed it toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is armed!&rdquo; cried Roger, and now there
was a note of fear in his voice, and not without
reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get behind the steel work,&rdquo; ordered Dave,
and lost no time in dodging partly out of sight.
As he moved, however, he launched forth the steel
bar he had picked up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></div>
<p>More by good luck than anything else the bar
sped true to its mark. It struck Ward Porton
in the forearm, the hand of which was holding the
pistol. In another instant the weapon was clattering
down through the steel work of the bridge
to the river far below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah, Dave! you&rsquo;ve disarmed him!&rdquo; cried
Roger.</p>
<p>For the instant Ward Porton seemed dazed by
the sudden turn of affairs. Evidently, however,
the blow from the steel bar had not hurt him
much, for, turning quickly, he continued his flight
along the bridge. Dave and Roger lost no time
in following him.</p>
<p>It was not long before the fugitive and those
behind him reached a section of the long bridge
which was far from completed. Here there was
practically no flooring, and Ward Porton had to
jump from one piece of steel work to another,
while Dave and Roger, of course, had to do the
same. Once those in the rear saw the rascal
ahead make a misstep and plunge downward.
But he saved himself, and, scrambling to his feet,
dashed forward as madly as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care, Dave, it&rsquo;s dangerous here,&rdquo;
gasped Roger; and scarcely had he spoken when
he himself made a misstep and shot down below
the level of the bridge flooring.</p>
<p>Dave was several feet in advance, but turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
instantly when his chum let out a cry of alarm.
He saw Roger four or five feet below him,
clinging frantically to one of the stays of the
bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hel&ndash;&ndash;help m&ndash;&ndash;me!&rdquo; panted the unfortunate
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold tight, Roger. I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; returned
Dave, quickly.</p>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_9' id='linki_9'></a>
</div>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i009.jpg' alt='' title='' width='323' height='500' /><br />
<p class='caption'>
<span class='smcap'>&ldquo;Hold tight, Roger! I&rsquo;ll help you,&rdquo; returned Dave, quickly.</span>&ndash;&ndash;<i>Page 255.</i><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>The stay below was so small in diameter that all
Roger could do was to cling to it with both hands
and one leg. In this position he hung until Dave
let himself down several feet and managed to give
him a hand. Then with extreme caution both
worked their way back to the unfinished flooring
of the bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my! I thought sure I was a goner!&rdquo;
panted the senator&rsquo;s son, when he found himself
safe once more. He had turned white and he
was trembling from head to foot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you had better not go any farther,
Roger,&rdquo; remarked Dave. &ldquo;This certainly is
dangerous work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder Porton doesn&rsquo;t fall,&rdquo; was the
other&rsquo;s comment, as they both watched the fleeing
rascal, who was leaping from girder to girder with
a recklessness that was truly amazing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s scared stiff at the idea of being captured,&rdquo;
was Dave&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for
that, I don&rsquo;t believe he would take any such
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
chance;&rdquo; and in this surmise our hero was probably
correct.</p>
<p>Dave hated to give up the chase, so he continued
his way along the bridge, making sure, however,
of every step and jump he took. Roger remained
where he was, too shaken up to proceed
farther when he knew that each step would prove
more hazardous than the last.</p>
<p>At last Ward Porton gained a point where one
of the foundations of the bridge rested on comparatively
solid ground, with the river behind and
a wide stretch of marshland ahead. Here there
was a long ladder used by the workmen, and down
this the rascal went as fast as his feet could carry
him. By the time Dave reached the top of the
ladder, Porton was well on his way over the solid
ground. Soon the gathering darkness hid him
from view.</p>
<p>Knowing that it would be next to useless to attempt
to follow the rascal now that he had left
the vicinity of the bridge, Dave returned to where
he had left Roger. Then the pair started slowly
back to the end of the bridge from which they had
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand what brought Ward Porton
here,&rdquo; remarked Roger, when the chums had
once more gained the swimming-place. &ldquo;Do you
suppose he knew you were in this vicinity, Dave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly, Roger. But at the same time, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
don&rsquo;t think that would explain his presence here.
He wouldn&rsquo;t dare to impersonate me around this
camp. He&rsquo;d be sure to be caught at it sooner or
later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t understand it at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I. I am sorry that we didn&rsquo;t
catch the rascal,&rdquo; returned Dave, soberly.</p>
<p>When they went back into camp they informed
Frank Andrews, and also Mr. Obray, of what had
occurred. These men had already heard some
of the particulars regarding Dave&rsquo;s double and
the disappearance of the Basswood fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad you didn&rsquo;t get him,&rdquo; said Frank Andrews.
&ldquo;But you be careful how you run over
that unfinished bridge, unless you want to have a
nasty fall and either get killed or else crippled for
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several days went by, including Sunday, and
nothing more was seen or heard of Ward Porton
although the lads made a thorough search for
him. Dave sent letters home and to Ben Basswood,
telling the folks in Crumville of what had
happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little greaser to see you, Dave,&rdquo; remarked
one of the civil engineers as Dave was coming
from an unusually difficult afternoon&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>He walked to where his fellow worker had
pointed, and there saw a dirty, unkempt Mexican
lad standing with a letter in his hand. The communication
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
was addressed to Dave, and, opening
it, he read the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I have broken with Tim Crapsey and have
the Basswood miniatures here with me safely in
Mexico. If the Basswoods will pay me ten thousand
dollars in cash they can have the pictures
back. Otherwise I am going to destroy them. I
will give them two weeks in which to make good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you are so close at hand, maybe you can
transact the business for Mr. Basswood. When
you are ready to open negotiations, send a letter
to the Bilassa camp, across the border, and I will
get it.</p>
<p style='margin-right:4em; text-align:right;'>&ldquo;<span class='smcap'>Ward Porton</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE</h3>
</div>
<p>Dave read the note from Ward Porton with
intense interest, and then passed it over to Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about that!&rdquo; exclaimed
the senator&rsquo;s son, after he had perused the communication.
&ldquo;Do you think Porton tells the
truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think, Roger. If he
does tell the truth, then it is quite likely that Tim
Crapsey was trying to play a double game so far
as the Basswoods were concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty clever on Porton&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; said
Roger, speculatively. &ldquo;He knows it would be
very difficult for us to get hold of him while he is
in Mexico, with this revolution going on. And at
the same time he is close enough to keep in touch
with you, knowing that you can easily transact
this business for the Basswoods&ndash;&ndash;providing, of
course, that Mr. Basswood is willing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave did not answer to this, for he was looking
around for the Mexican youth who had delivered
the note. But the boy had slipped away, and a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
search of the camp failed to reveal what had become
of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he was instructed to sneak away without
being seen,&rdquo; was our hero&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;Porton
knew that I wouldn&rsquo;t be in a position to answer
him at once, and he didn&rsquo;t want me to follow that
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave read the note again, and then went off to
consult with Frank Andrews and Mr. Obray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad you didn&rsquo;t capture that little
greaser,&rdquo; observed the head of the civil engineers.
&ldquo;We might have been able to get some
information from him. However, if he&rsquo;s gone
that&rsquo;s the end of it. I think the best thing you
can do, Porter, is to send a night message to this
Mr. Basswood, telling him how the note was received
and repeating it word for word. Then the
responsibility for what may follow will not rest on
your shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero thought this good advice, and, aided
by his chum, he concocted what is familiarly known
as a Night Letter, to be sent by telegraph to Crumville.</p>
<p>On the following day came a surprise for our
hero in the shape of a short message from Ben
Basswood which ran as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Yours regarding Porton received. Crapsey
makes another offer. Pair probably enemies
now. Will write or wire instructions later.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;This is certainly getting interesting,&rdquo; remarked
Dave, after having read the message.
He turned it over to Roger. &ldquo;I guess Ben is
right&ndash;&ndash;Crapsey and Porton have fallen out and
each is claiming to have the miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, one or the other must have them,
Dave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they divided them, Roger. Thieves
often do that sort of thing, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Ward Porton is really around
that Bilassa camp in Mexico?&rdquo; went on the senator&rsquo;s
son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he is hanging out somewhere in that
vicinity. I don&rsquo;t think he has joined General
Bilassa. He thinks too much of his own neck to
become a soldier in any revolution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having sent his message to the Basswoods and
received Ben&rsquo;s reply, there seemed nothing further
for our hero to do but to wait. He and Roger
were very busy helping to survey the route beyond
the new Catalco bridge, and in the fascination of
this occupation Ward Porton was, for the next
few days, almost forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Basswoods expect you to do anything
regarding that note you got from Porton they had
better get busy before long,&rdquo; remarked Roger one
evening. &ldquo;Otherwise Porton may do as he
threatened&ndash;&ndash;destroy the pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;d do anything of that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
sort, Roger,&rdquo; answered Dave. &ldquo;What would be
the use? I think he would prefer to hide them
somewhere, thinking that some day he would be
able to make money out of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four days after this came a bulky letter from
Ben Basswood which Dave and his chum read
eagerly. It was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I write to let you know that Tim Crapsey has
been caught at last. He was traced to New York
and then to Newark, N. J., where the police found
him in a second-rate hotel. He had been drinking,
and confessed that he had had a row with
Ward Porton and that one night, when he was
under the influence of liquor, Porton had decamped,
taking all but two of the miniatures with
him. The two miniatures had been sold to a
fence in New York City for one hundred dollars,
and the police think they can easily get them back.
With the hundred dollars Crapsey had evidently
gone on a spree, and it was during this that Porton
sneaked away with the other miniatures.
Crapsey had an idea that Porton was bound for
Boston, where he would take a steamer for Europe.
But we know he was mistaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case being as it is, my father, as well as
your folks and Mr. Wadsworth, thinks that Porton
must have the pictures with him in Mexico.
That being the case, your Uncle Dunston says he
will come down to Texas at once to see you, and
I am to come with him. What will be done in
the matter I don&rsquo;t know, although my father
would much rather give up ten thousand dollars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
than have the miniatures destroyed. If you
receive any further word from Ward Porton tell
him that I am coming down to negotiate with
him. You had better not mention your uncle&rsquo;s
name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if Porton told the truth after all,&rdquo;
announced Roger. &ldquo;Probably he watched his
opportunity and the first chance he got he decamped
and left Crapsey to take care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most likely, Roger. I don&rsquo;t believe there is
any honor among thieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben had not said how soon he and Dunston
Porter would arrive. But as they would probably
follow the letter the two chums looked for
the pair on almost every train. But two days
passed, and neither put in an appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must have been delayed by something,&rdquo;
was Dave&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they are trying to get that ten thousand
dollars together,&rdquo; suggested Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe my Uncle Dunston will offer
Porton any such money right away,&rdquo; returned our
hero. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll see first if he can&rsquo;t work it so as
to capture the rascal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the following morning Roger was sent
southward on an errand for Mr. Obray. When
he returned he was very much excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dave, I think I saw Ward Porton again!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, as he rushed up to our hero.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Where was that?&rdquo; questioned Dave, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down on that road which leads to the Rio
Grande. There was a fellow talking to a ranchman
I&rsquo;ve met several times, a Texan named Lawson.
As soon as he saw me he took to his heels.
I questioned Lawson about him and he said the
fellow had come across the river at a point about a
quarter of a mile below here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave listened to this explanation with interest,
and immediately sought out Mr. Obray. The upshot
of the talk was that our hero was given permission
to leave the camp for the day, taking
Roger with him.</p>
<p>The two chums went off armed with their
pistols, not knowing what might happen. They
first walked to where Roger had met the ranchman,
and there the senator&rsquo;s son pointed out the
direction that the young man who had run away
had taken. They followed this trail, and presently
reached the roadway which ran in sight of
the river. There were comparatively few craft
on the stream, and none of these looked as if it
might be occupied by the young man they were
after. But presently they reached a small creek
flowing into the Rio Grande, and on this saw two
flat-bottomed rowboats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is now!&rdquo; exclaimed Dave, suddenly,
and pointed to the first of the rowboats,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
which was being sent down the creek in the direction
of the river.</p>
<p>The sole occupant of the craft was the fellow at
the oars, and the two chums readily made out that
it was the former moving-picture actor. As
soon as he made certain of Porton&rsquo;s identity, Dave
pulled Roger down in the tall grass which bordered
the creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no use in letting him see us,&rdquo; explained
our hero.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he is bound for the Mexican
shore?&rdquo; questioned the senator&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than likely, Roger.&rdquo; Dave looked
questioningly at his chum. &ldquo;Are you game to follow
him?&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might take that other rowboat and go
after him. I see it contains a pair of oars.
Either of us ought to be able to row as well as
Porton, and if we can catch him before he lands
maybe we&rsquo;ll be able to drive him back to the
United States side of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll <a name='TC_4'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'go you'">go with you</ins>,&rdquo; responded Roger,
quickly. &ldquo;Come ahead!&rdquo; and he started on a
run for the rowboat.</p>
<p>The craft was tied fast to two stakes, but it was
an easy matter for them to loosen the ropes.
This done, Dave took up the oars, shoved off,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
and started to row with all the strength at his command.</p>
<p>Evidently Ward Porton had not expected to be
followed, for he was rowing leisurely, allowing his
flat-bottomed boat to drift with the current. He
was much surprised when he saw the other boat
come on at a good rate of speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back there!&rdquo; he yelled, when he recognized
the occupants of the second craft. &ldquo;Get
back, I tell you, or I&rsquo;ll shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do we&rsquo;ll do some shooting on our own
account, Porton!&rdquo; called back Roger, and showed
his pistol.</p>
<p>The sight of the weapon evidently frightened
Porton greatly. Yet he did not cease rowing, and
now he headed directly for the Mexican shore.</p>
<p>The river at this point was broad and shallow
and contained numerous sand-bars. Almost before
they knew it the craft containing our friends
ran up on one of the bars and stuck there. In
the meantime Ward Porton continued his efforts
to gain the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Dave?&rdquo; cried Roger,
when he saw our hero stop rowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are aground,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Here,
Roger, get to the stern of the boat with me, and
we&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t shove her off again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the two chums in the stern of the craft,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
the bow came up out of the sand-bar, and in a
few seconds more Dave, aided by the current of
the stream, managed to get the rowboat clear.
But all this had taken time, and now the two
chums saw that Ward Porton had beached his
boat and was running across the marshland beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he is going to get away,&rdquo; remarked
Roger, dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; answered Dave. &ldquo;Anyway,
I&rsquo;m not going to give up yet,&rdquo; and he resumed his
rowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, let me take a turn at that. You must
be getting a little tired,&rdquo; said Roger, and he insisted
that Dave allow him to do the rowing.</p>
<p>Soon they reached the Mexican shore, at a
point where there was a wide stretch of marshland
with not a building in sight. They had gotten
several glimpses of Ward Porton making his way
through the tall grass. The trail was an easy
one to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on! We&rsquo;ll get him yet!&rdquo; muttered
Dave, and started off on the run with Roger behind
him.</p>
<p>They had just reached an ill-kept highway
when they heard shouting in the distance. They
saw Ward Porton running wildly in the direction
of a set of low buildings, evidently belonging
to some sort of ranch. As the former moving-picture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
actor disappeared, a band of Mexican
cavalry swept into view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Roger! Down in the grass!&rdquo; cried
Dave. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want those soldiers to see
us! They may be government troops, but they
look more like guerrillas&ndash;&ndash;like the rascals who
raided the Tolman ranch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; answered the senator&rsquo;s son.
And then both lay low in the tall grass while the
Mexican guerrillas, for they were nothing else,
swept past them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE DISCOVERY</h3>
</div>
<p>As nearly as Dave and Roger could calculate,
there were about two hundred of the Mexican
guerrillas&ndash;&ndash;dirty and fierce-looking individuals,
led by an officer wearing an enormous hat and a
long, drooping mustache.</p>
<p>The entire crowd looked disreputable in the
extreme, and the youths could not help but shudder
as they gazed at the cavalcade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious, Dave! do you call those revolutionists?&rdquo;
remarked Roger, after the last of
the horsemen had disappeared down the roadway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be revolutionists, Roger. But to
my mind they look more like bandits than anything
else. Under the pretense of aiding Mexico
they probably steal whenever they get the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate awfully to fall into their clutches.
I think they&rsquo;d rob a fellow of every dollar he
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, never mind those Mexicans, Roger,&rdquo;
pursued Dave. &ldquo;Come on, let us see if we can&rsquo;t
locate Ward Porton.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He went over into one of yonder buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, and I&rsquo;ve got an idea,&rdquo; answered
our hero. &ldquo;Let us see if we can&rsquo;t sneak across
the roadway without being seen and then come
up to those buildings through the thick grass and
behind that chaparral. If we expose ourselves
Porton will, of course, keep out of our sight or
run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With extreme caution the two chums worked
their way through the tall grass to the edge of the
roadway. Then, watching their chance when nobody
seemed to be looking, they dashed to the
other side and into the grass again. Then they
began to work their way cautiously in the direction
of the group of buildings into which
the former moving-picture actor had disappeared.</p>
<p>The buildings belonged to a Mexican ranch;
but the place had evidently been the scene of a
fight at some time in the past, for one of the buildings
was completely wrecked and several of the
others much battered. There were no horses,
cattle, pigs, or chickens anywhere in sight; and the
youths came to the conclusion that the ranch had
been abandoned by its owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably some of those guerrillas came along
and cleaned him out,&rdquo; observed Dave, &ldquo;and after
that he didn&rsquo;t think it would be worth while to
stay so long as the country was in a state of war.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></div>
<p>In a few minutes more Dave and his chum
gained the first of the buildings. Here they
paused to listen and to look around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to be on your guard, Roger,&rdquo; whispered
our hero. &ldquo;Porton may be watching us
and he may have some of his friends here. For
all we know this may be his hang-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be on guard, don&rsquo;t fear,&rdquo; answered the
senator&rsquo;s son, and brought forth his pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use that gun unless you have to,&rdquo;
warned Dave, who did not favor any shooting,
even in an extreme case like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not give a rascal like Porton the chance to
shoot me first,&rdquo; retorted Roger. &ldquo;That fellow
ought to be in jail, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this our hero did not answer. He felt in
his pocket to make sure that his own weapon was
ready for use.</p>
<p>Not a sound from the other buildings had
reached them, nor did any one appear to be in
sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks to me as if we were in sole possession,
now that those guerrillas have gone,&rdquo; announced
Roger. &ldquo;Wow! I hope they don&rsquo;t come back,&ndash;&ndash;at
least not until we are safe on our side of the
Rio Grande,&rdquo; he added grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, we&rsquo;ll take a look through the buildings,&rdquo;
answered Dave. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make any noise
if you can possibly help it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>Leaving the building which they had first
entered&ndash;&ndash;an abandoned stable&ndash;&ndash;they moved
through a broken-down cow-shed to a long, low
structure which had evidently been used by the
helpers on the ranch. This building was also deserted,
and all that remained in it was some filthy
bedding alive with vermin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let us get out of here,&rdquo; remarked
Roger, as he looked with disfavor at the squalor
presented. &ldquo;How can human beings live like
this, Dave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Roger. This place ought to be
burned down&ndash;&ndash;it&rsquo;s the only way to get it clean,&rdquo;
Dave added, shaking his head in disgust over the
sight.</p>
<p>Less than fifty feet away was the corner of the
main building of the ranch. Peering out cautiously,
to make sure that no one was watching
them, the two chums hurried across the open space
and crouched down beneath a wide-open window.
Then Dave, pistol in hand, looked in through the
opening.</p>
<p>The room beyond was deserted, and a glance
around showed him that it contained little besides
some heavy pieces of furniture which the looters
had evidently been unable to remove. On a table
rested several empty liquor bottles, and also a
number of cigar and cigarette stubs. On the floor
were scattered newspapers and some playing cards.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The fellows who were here evidently got out
in a hurry,&rdquo; remarked Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to go in?&rdquo; questioned Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. What do you think about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you, Dave. Now we have gone so
far, we might as well finish the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was an easy matter for the two chums to climb
through the low window. Once in the room, they
advanced toward a doorway leading to an apartment
that opened on the <i>patio</i> of the ranch home&ndash;&ndash;an
open courtyard which had once boasted of a
well-kept flower garden, but which was now neglected
and overrun with weeds.</p>
<p>As Dave gazed out across the <i>patio</i> he saw a
movement in a room on the opposite side of the
ranch home. The face of a man had appeared
for a few seconds. Behind him was some one else&ndash;&ndash;who,
however, Dave could not make out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious, Roger!&rdquo; gasped our hero in a
low voice. &ldquo;Did you see that fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw some one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was William Jarvey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jarvey! Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am certain of it. Now what do you think
of that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know what to think, Dave.
Maybe he is making his headquarters here, the
same as Ward Porton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to try to find out. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></div>
<p>Our hero made a quick mental calculation as to
the ground plan of the ranch homeland then he
and Roger began to work their way from one
room to another, and then through a long, narrow
hallway, until they reached the other side of
the building. Here they paused at the end of the
hallway to listen.</p>
<p>From a room close at hand came a murmur of
voices. By straining his ears Dave made out the
tones of William Jarvey. The former bookkeeper
for the Mentor Construction Company was
evidently talking to another man, but what was
being said was not distinguishable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jarvey all right enough,&rdquo; whispered
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But that isn&rsquo;t Ward Porton with him,&rdquo;
returned Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. It&rsquo;s some man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both continued to listen, and presently heard
William Jarvey give a sarcastic laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got another guess coming, Packard
Brown, if you think you are going to get that much
out of the deal!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Remember, you
haven&rsquo;t done a thing to help us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Bill Jarvey,&rdquo; retorted the
man called Packard Brown. &ldquo;When we left the
U. S. A. and came over here it was understood
that we were to share and share alike in everything.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t think this new thing was coming
up,&rdquo; growled Jarvey. &ldquo;We were to share
equal on what we happened to get out of the greasers.
This is another thing entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admit that. Just the same, I think I&rsquo;m entitled
to my share.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you help us all you can and you&rsquo;ll get a
nice little wad out of it, Brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What more was said on this subject did not
reach the ears of Dave and Roger, for just then
the latter pulled our hero by the sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s Porton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dave did not answer. At the end of the semi-dark
hallway there was a closet which in years
gone by had been used for the storage of guns and
clothing. Into this closet the two youths went,
closing the door carefully after them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Porton all right enough,&rdquo; whispered
Dave, who a moment later was crouching low
and looking through a large keyhole devoid of a
key. &ldquo;There he goes into the room where the
two men are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then those two men must be in with him,&rdquo; returned
the senator&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Say, Dave, this is
certainly getting interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to make our job a pretty hard one,&rdquo;
answered our hero. &ldquo;If Ward Porton was alone
we might be able to capture him. But I don&rsquo;t see
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
how we are going to do it with Jarvey and that
man named Brown present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe if we offer Jarvey and Brown a large
reward they will help us make Porton a prisoner,&rdquo;
suggested Roger. &ldquo;More than likely Jarvey is
on his uppers and will do anything to get a little
cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two youths came out into the semi-dark
hallway once more, and on tiptoes crept toward
the door of the room occupied by Ward Porton
and the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went all around the buildings, and looked up
and down the roadway, but I couldn&rsquo;t see anything
of them,&rdquo; the former moving-picture actor was
saying. &ldquo;I guess they got cold feet when they
saw those soldiers. Say, those greasers certainly
were a fierce-looking bunch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe they were any of General
Bilassa&rsquo;s army,&rdquo; returned William Jarvey.
&ldquo;They were probably some detachment out for
whatever they could lay their hands on,&rdquo; and he
chuckled coarsely. Evidently he considered that
such guerrilla warfare under certain circumstances
was perfectly justifiable.</p>
<p>Following this there was some talk which neither
of those outside the door could catch. Then came
a rather loud exclamation from Ward Porton
which startled our friends more than anything else
that could have been said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, look here, Dad!&rdquo; cried the former
moving-picture actor. &ldquo;You let me run this
affair. I started it, and I know I can put it
through successfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Jarvey!&rdquo; broke in Packard
Brown. &ldquo;Let your son go ahead and work this
deal out to suit himself. He seems to have made
a success of it so far&ndash;&ndash;getting the best of that
fellow Crapsey,&rdquo; and the speaker chuckled.</p>
<p>Dave and Roger looked at each other knowingly.
Here indeed was a revelation. Evidently
Ward Porton was the son of the man they knew
as William Jarvey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious! I remember now!&rdquo; burst out
our hero in a low tone. &ldquo;When we went to Burlington
to see that old man, Obadiah Jones, about
Ward don&rsquo;t you remember that he told us that
Ward was the son of a good-for-nothing lieutenant
in the army named Jarvey Porton? That man
Pankhurst who was captured declared that Jarvey
was living under an assumed name and had been
an officer in the army. It must be true, Roger.
This fellow is really Jarvey Porton, and he is
Ward Porton&rsquo;s father!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>THE CAPTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>What Dave said concerning the man he had
known as William Jarvey was true. He was in
reality Ward Porton&rsquo;s father, his full name being
William Jarvey Porton. Years before, however,
on entering the United States Army, he had
dropped the name William and been known only
as Jarvey Porton. Later, on being dismissed
from the army for irregularities in his accounts,
he had assumed the name of William Jarvey.</p>
<p>A lively discussion lasting several minutes, and
which our hero and Roger failed to catch, followed
the discovery of Jarvey Porton&rsquo;s identity.
Then the listeners heard the former lieutenant
say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brown, I think you had better go outside and
watch to make sure that no one is coming to this
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, just as you say,&rdquo; was the other
man&rsquo;s answer. Evidently he understood that this
was a hint that Jarvey Porton wished to speak to
his son in private.</p>
<p>As Packard Brown placed his hand on the door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
leading to the semi-dark hallway Dave and Roger
lost no time in tiptoeing their way back to the
closet in which they had before hidden. From
this place they saw Brown leave the room and walk
outside. Then they returned to their position at
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure the cases are in a safe place,
Ward?&rdquo; they heard Jarvey Porton ask anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure of it, Dad. I hid them with great
care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure nobody saw you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On a high knoll not far from where we have
been tying up the boats,&rdquo; answered Ward Porton.
&ldquo;There are a number of big rocks there,
and I found a fine <i>cache</i> between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather dangerous to leave them around
that way,&rdquo; grumbled the man. &ldquo;Maybe you
would have done better if you had brought them
over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought there would be no use in carting
them back and forth,&rdquo; returned the son. &ldquo;I
wanted to have them handy, in case the Basswoods
met my demands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll see what comes of it, Ward. I
hope we do get that money. I certainly need
some,&rdquo; and Jarvey Porton heaved something of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
a sigh. Evidently father and son were equally unscrupulous
and took no pains to disguise that fact
from each other.</p>
<p>More talk followed, Ward telling something
of the way in which the miniatures had been obtained
and his father relating the particulars of
his troubles with the Mentor Construction Company.
In the midst of the latter recital Dave
and Roger heard Packard Brown returning on
the run.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi there!&rdquo; called out the man in evident
alarm. And then as the two chums hid in the
closet once more, he burst into the room occupied
by the Portons. &ldquo;Those greasers are coming
back and they are heading for this place!&rdquo; he explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case we had better get out,&rdquo; answered
Jarvey Porton, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you and Brown helped them in that raid,
Dad,&rdquo; interposed the son. &ldquo;Why should you
get out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a big quarrel after that raid, Ward,&rdquo;
explained the parent. &ldquo;And now those greasers
have no use for us. We&rsquo;ll have to get out, and
in a hurry, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shouting could now be heard at a distance, and
this was followed by a volley of shots which surprised
all the listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it must be,&rdquo; said Jarvey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
Porton, as he led the way from the deserted
ranch. &ldquo;A detachment from the regular army
must be after General Bilassa&rsquo;s crowd. Maybe
they&rsquo;ll have a fight right here along the border!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to get mixed up in any fight!&rdquo;
exclaimed Ward Porton. &ldquo;Maybe we had better
get back to the United States side of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; put in Packard Brown.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All left the ranch and headed directly for the
river, at the point where Ward had left his flat-bottomed
rowboat. Dave and Roger followed
them, but did their best to keep out of sight in
the tall grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave, I hope they do go over to the
other shore!&rdquo; exclaimed the senator&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;It
will be so much easier to capture them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, Roger. And don&rsquo;t you remember
what Ward told his father&ndash;&ndash;that he had left the
miniature cases hidden on the other side? He
said they were on a high knoll not far from where
the boats had been tied up. We ought to be able
to find that <i>cache</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By the time the two chums gained the shore of
the Rio Grande those ahead of them had already
entered Ward Porton&rsquo;s boat. Ward and Brown
each had an oar and rowed as rapidly as possible
to the other side of the stream. Jarvey Porton
sat in the stern of the craft, and looked back from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
time to time, trying to catch sight of the guerrillas
and the other Mexicans, who were still shouting
and firing at a distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better hold back a bit, Dave, so
they don&rsquo;t see you?&rdquo; questioned Roger, as he and
our hero managed to gain the rowboat they had
used, which, fortunately, had been placed some
distance away from the other craft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good advice, Roger, if it wasn&rsquo;t for one thing.
I don&rsquo;t want to give them a chance to get out of
our sight. Let us tie our handkerchiefs over the
lower parts of our faces. Then they won&rsquo;t be
able to recognize us&ndash;&ndash;at least unless we get
pretty close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Dave&rsquo;s suggestion carried out, the chums
leaped into the rowboat, and, this done, each took
an oar. They pulled hard, and as a consequence
reached the mouth of the little creek on the United
States side in time to see those ahead just disembarking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose they are going?&rdquo;
queried the senator&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That remains to be found out,&rdquo; answered
Dave. &ldquo;Duck now, so they won&rsquo;t see us.&rdquo; And
with a quick motion of the oar he possessed he
sent the flat-bottomed boat in among some tall
grass which bordered the creek at this point.</p>
<p>Ward Porton and those with him had tied up
their boat and were walking to the higher ground
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
away from the creek. Jarvey Porton paused to
look back along the creek and the bosom of the
river beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything on the river just now,&rdquo;
he announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Some one is coming from the other
way!&rdquo; exclaimed his son, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Lawson, the ranchman?&rdquo; questioned
Packard Brown, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think it is,&rdquo; answered Ward Porton.
&ldquo;They seem to be strangers,&rdquo; he added, a
minute later.</p>
<p>Two men and a well-grown boy were approaching.
They came on slowly, as if looking for some
one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what those fellows want
around here,&rdquo; came from Jarvey Porton, as he
gave up looking along the river to inspect the
newcomers.</p>
<p>From their position in the tall grass bordering
the creek, Dave and Roger looked from the Porton
party to those who were approaching. Then,
of a sudden, our hero uttered a low exclamation
of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look who&rsquo;s here, Roger! Ben Basswood
and my Uncle Dunston! And Mr. Andrews is
with them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am! I would know my Uncle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
Dunston as far as I could see him. And you
ought to know Ben.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My gracious, Dave, you&rsquo;re right! This sure
is luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what I&rsquo;m going to do,&rdquo; decided our
hero, quickly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to send both of the
boats adrift. Then, no matter what happens,
those rascals won&rsquo;t have any easy time of it getting
back to Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In feverish haste Dave sent the flat-bottomed
boat out into the creek once more. Roger assisted
him, and a few strokes of the oars brought
the craft alongside of that which had been used
by the Porton party. Then the chums leaped
ashore, threw all the oars into the water, and
set both of the rowboats adrift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi there! What are you fellows up to?&rdquo;
came suddenly from Packard Brown, who had
happened to look behind him. &ldquo;See, Jarvey,
those two fellows have cast our boat adrift!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are they?&rdquo; demanded Jarvey Porton,
and looked in some bewilderment at the two
figures approaching, each with a handkerchief
tied over the lower portion of the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Dunston! Ben!&rdquo; cried Dave at the
top of his lungs, and at the same time whipped
the handkerchief from his face. &ldquo;Here are
Ward Porton and his father! We must capture
them!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up! Don&rsquo;t let them get away!&rdquo; put
in Roger, as he, too, uncovered his face.</p>
<p>As he uttered the words Roger drew his pistol,
an action which was quickly followed by our
hero, for both understood that the criminals before
them might prove desperate.</p>
<p>Of course Dunston Porton and Ben Basswood,
as well as Frank Andrews, were greatly astonished
by the calls from Dave and Roger. But
our hero&rsquo;s uncle, while out hunting in various
parts of the world, had been in many a tight corner,
and thus learned the value of acting quickly.
He had with him his pistol, and almost instantly
he drew this weapon and came forward on the
run, with Ben and Frank Andrews at his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop! Don&rsquo;t shoot!&rdquo; yelled Ward
Porton in alarm, as he found himself and his companions
surrounded by five others, three with
drawn pistols.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t shoot, Porton, if you&rsquo;ll surrender,&rdquo;
answered Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! has he got those miniatures?&rdquo;
burst out Ben.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sure has, Ben!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t got any miniatures,&rdquo; growled the
former moving-picture actor.</p>
<p>His father and Brown looked decidedly uncomfortable.
Once the former army officer made a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
motion as if to draw his own weapon, but Dunston
Porter detected the movement and instantly ordered
all of the party to throw up their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dave! are you sure he has those pictures?&rdquo;
queried Ben, and his face showed his anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, Ben. However, we&rsquo;ll find out as
soon as we have made them prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the talk!&rdquo; put in Roger. He turned
to Dave&rsquo;s uncle. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you bind them or something,
so that they can&rsquo;t get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll disarm them,&rdquo; announced Frank Andrews.
&ldquo;Jarvey and Brown are wanted for that
raid on old man Tolman&rsquo;s ranch and for using
that bomb on the bridge. We can prove through
Pankhurst that they were with the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man is Ward Porton&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; explained
Dave to his uncle and Ben, while the evil-doers
were being searched and disarmed one after
another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ward Porton&rsquo;s father, eh? Well, they seem
to be two of a kind,&rdquo; answered Ben.</p>
<p>With their weapons taken from them, the
prisoners could do nothing but submit. They
were questioned, but all refused to tell anything
about what they had done or intended to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never get anything out of me, and
you&rsquo;ll never get those miniatures back,&rdquo; growled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
Ward Porton, as he gazed sourly at Ben and at
Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that, Porton,&rdquo; answered our
hero. And then he requested his uncle and Frank
Andrews to keep an eye on the prisoners while
he, Roger and Ben set out for the knoll some
distance away from the creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ward Porton said he had hidden some cases
in a <i>cache</i> between some rocks on that knoll,&rdquo; explained
our hero. &ldquo;By cases I think he meant
those containing the miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope he did!&rdquo; returned Ben, wistfully.
&ldquo;To get those miniatures back means so
much to my folks!&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE FORTUNE RECOVERED&ndash;&ndash;CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p>As Dave, Roger, and Ben tramped through
the tall grass to where was located a knoll of considerable
size, the son of the Crumville real estate
dealer related how he and Dunston Porter had
arrived in the construction camp and how they had
gotten Frank Andrews to show them in what direction
our hero and the senator&rsquo;s son had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew you were after Porton, and we
hoped to catch sight of that rascal,&rdquo; went on
Ben, &ldquo;but we didn&rsquo;t dream that we were going to
capture Ward and also those two men who are
wanted for that raid on the Tolman ranch. And
to think that one of the men is Ward&rsquo;s father!
He certainly must be a bad egg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, Ben,&rdquo; answered Dave. &ldquo;And Ward
is a chip of the old block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chums were soon ascending the knoll, containing
many rocks between which were dense
clumps of chaparral. Here they had to advance
with care so as not to turn an ankle or get their
clothing torn.</p>
<p>Dave had hoped that the search for the missing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span>
cases would be an easy one, but in that he was
disappointed. The three chums walked all
around the knoll several times without getting anything
in the way of a clue as to where Porton&rsquo;s
<i>cache</i> was located.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo; burst out Roger at length.
&ldquo;If we could only&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; He looked quickly at
Dave. &ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our hero did not reply. Instead he hurried
forward several feet, and then gave a low cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Porton has been here!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and
held up a half-burned cigarette.</p>
<p>It was not much of a clue, but it was something;
and working on this all three of the youths
searched the vicinity diligently. They soon came
upon a somewhat flat rock, and all seized hold of
this to cast it to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; came simultaneously from Dave
and Roger, as they saw a large opening under
where the stone had been placed.</p>
<p>Ben said nothing, but plunged his hand into the
opening, to draw from it an instant later one of
the cases that had contained the Enos miniatures.
The other cases quickly followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the miniatures in them?&rdquo; questioned the
senator&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to find out,&rdquo; answered
Ben.</p>
<p>The cases were fastened by several catches,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
but these were quickly unfastened and the lids
thrown open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Ben, and his face
showed his intense satisfaction.</p>
<p>There before the eyes of the youths were nearly
all of the wonderful collection of miniatures which
Mr. Basswood had inherited. Only two were
missing&ndash;&ndash;those which the thieves had sold in
New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is simply grand!&rdquo; cried Roger, enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; added Dave, and then
went on quickly: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get these to
some safe place and then make sure that they&rsquo;ll
never be stolen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry about that, Dave. I won&rsquo;t
let them out of my sight until they are safe and
sound,&rdquo; declared the real estate dealer&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Locking up the cases once more, the three
youths carried them off the knoll and through the
chaparral to where they had left Dunston Porter
and the others. Of course, Dave&rsquo;s uncle was
much gratified to learn that the miniatures had
been recovered, and Frank Andrews was also
pleased. Jarvey Porton looked downcast, and
his son showed his deep disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a fool not to take them over into
Mexico,&rdquo; remarked the former moving-picture
actor.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I told you that was what you should
have done,&rdquo; retorted his father. And then he
added in a low tone: &ldquo;We might have purchased
our freedom with those miniatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Dunston Porter and Frank Andrews
looked after the prisoners to see that they did not
get away, Dave and his chums took care of the
cases containing the precious miniatures, and thus
the whole party made its way to the engineering
and construction camp. There the Portons and
Packard Brown were handcuffed, and word was
sent to the authorities to take charge of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I&rsquo;ve got to send word home about
this good news!&rdquo; cried Ben, and lost no time in
getting off a long telegram to his folks, and asking
them to inform Dave&rsquo;s father and the Wadsworths
by telephone of the success of the trip to
Texas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That message ought to do your father more
good than a dose of medicine,&rdquo; remarked Dave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will, Dave,&rdquo; answered Ben, his face beaming.
&ldquo;I know father will recover now that he has
nothing more to worry about.&rdquo; Ben was right.
The recovery of the fortune in miniatures did
much toward restoring the real estate dealer to his
former good health.</p>
<p>In the camp it was remarked by a number of
men how much Ward Porton resembled Dave.
But no one at that time dreamed that this resemblance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
was shortly to come to an end. Yet
such was a fact. When being transferred from
Texas to the State in which his crimes had been
committed, Ward Porton attempted to make his
escape by leaping from a rapidly moving railroad
train. As a consequence he broke not only both
of his legs, but also his nose, and cut his right
cheek most frightfully. As a result, when he was
retaken he had to remain in the hospital for a long
time, and when he came out his face was much disfigured
and he walked with a decided limp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad, but he brought it on himself,&rdquo;
was Dave&rsquo;s comment, when he heard of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing in one respect,&rdquo; was Roger&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;With his nose broken and his cheek
disfigured and with such a limp, no one will ever
take Ward Porton for you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be mentioned here that when the proper
time came Ward Porton and Tim Crapsey were
brought to trial and each was given a long term
of imprisonment. Ward&rsquo;s father and the other
men who had participated in the attack on the
Tolman ranch and on the bridge and had been
captured were also severely punished.</p>
<p>The store-keepers and the hotel-keeper who
suffered through Ward Porton&rsquo;s misrepresentations
could get nothing from the young culprit,
but they had the satisfaction of knowing that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
had now been put where it would be impossible
for him to dupe others.</p>
<p>Ben Basswood remained at the camp but a few
days, and then he and Dunston Porter started
northward. The miniatures had been boxed up
and shipped by express, insured for their full
value. It may be stated here that they arrived
safely at their destination. Those which
had been disposed of in New York City were recovered,
and in the end Mr. Basswood disposed
of the entire collection to the museums in four of
our large cities for the sum of seventy-five thousand
dollars. With part of this money he went
into several heavy real estate deals, taking Ben
in with him, and father and son did very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the getting back of those miniatures
was entirely your work, Dave,&rdquo; declared Roger,
one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; answered our hero,
modestly. &ldquo;I think you had a hand in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a hand in catching Ward Porton, but
you were the one to spot that <i>cache</i> and locate the
Basswood fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>And now let me add a few words more and
then bring to an end this story of &ldquo;Dave Porter
and His Double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A number of years have passed since Dave
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
graduated from Oak Hall and took up the profession
of a civil engineer. Both he and Roger
learned rapidly, and at the end of the required
time both passed their final examinations with
flying colors. They remained with the Mentor
Construction Company, journeying all over the
United States, and also going down into Mexico
and into Central and South Americas. They, of
course, met with numerous adventures, some of
which I may relate to you at a future time. They
returned to Crumville a number of times, and
during those visits Dave was more attentive to
Jessie than ever, while Roger spent nearly all his
time at Laura&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll make a fine pair of married couples,&rdquo;
declared Dave&rsquo;s Uncle Dunston.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I hope they&rsquo;ll be happy,&rdquo; answered
Dave&rsquo;s father. &ldquo;They certainly deserve to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. But I guess they had better
wait awhile yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. They are young, and Dave and
Roger want to get a good foothold in their
profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those boys have had some strenuous doings,&rdquo;
continued the uncle. &ldquo;I wonder what will happen
next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; answered Dave&rsquo;s
father; and he was right, as will be related in my
next volume, to be entitled, &ldquo;Dave Porter&rsquo;s Great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
Search; or, The Perils of a Young Civil Engineer.&rdquo;
In that book we will meet all our young friends
again, and learn the particulars of Jessie Wadsworth&rsquo;s
strange disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great days, those&ndash;&ndash;on the Rio Grande,
Dave!&rdquo; remarked Roger, one day, when the two
